  abstract = {Linear regression in Lp-norm is a canonical optimization problem that arises in several applications, including sparse recovery, semi-supervised learning, and signal processing. Generic convex optimization algorithms for solving Lp-regression are slow in practice. Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) is an easy to implement family of algorithms for solving these problems that has been studied for over 50 years. However, these algorithms often diverge for p {$>$} 3, and since the work of Osborne (1985), it has been an open problem whether there is an IRLS algorithm that converges for p {$>$} 3. We propose p-IRLS, the first IRLS algorithm that provably converges geometrically for any p \textbackslash in [2,\textbackslash infty). Our algorithm is simple to implement and is guaranteed to find a high accuracy solution in a sub-linear number of iterations. Our experiments demonstrate that it performs even better than our theoretical bounds, beats the standard Matlab/CVX implementation for solving these problems by 10–50x, and is the fastest among available implementations in the high-accuracy regime.},

It performs functional annotation of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), maps coding SNPs to gene transcripts, extracts protein sequence annotations and structural attributes, and builds conservation profiles. It then estimates the probability of the missense mutation being damaging based on a combination of all these properties. PolyPhen-2 features include a high-quality multiple protein sequence alignment pipeline and a prediction method employing machine-learning classification. The software also integrates the UCSC Genome Browser’s human genome annotations and MultiZ multiple alignments of vertebrate genomes with the human genome. PolyPhen-2 is capable of analyzing large volumes of data produced by next-generation sequencing projects, thanks to built-in support for high-performance computing environments like Grid Engine and Platform LSF.},

We show that the running time one can achieve depends on the square of the diameter of the point set, \$B\$, with a transition at \$B = \textbackslash Theta(\textbackslash log n)\$ mirroring the corresponding transition in \$d\_\{B; \textbackslash delta\} (e\^\{-x\})\$: - When \$B=o(\textbackslash log n)\$, we give the first algorithm running in time \$n\^\{1 + o(1)\}\$. - When \$B = \textbackslash kappa \textbackslash log n\$ for a small constant \$\textbackslash kappa{$>$}0\$, we give an algorithm running in time \$n\^\{1 + O(\textbackslash log \textbackslash log \textbackslash kappa\^\{-1\} /\textbackslash log \textbackslash kappa\^\{-1\})\}\$.

In theory, Bayesian methods for discovering pairwise interactions enjoy many benefits such as coherent uncertainty quantification, the ability to incorporate background knowledge, and desirable shrinkage properties.

  abstract = {Many scientific problems require identifying a small set of covariates that are associated with a target response and estimating their effects. Often, these effects are nonlinear and include interactions, so linear and additive methods can lead to poor estimation and variable selection. Unfortunately, methods that simultaneously express sparsity, nonlinearity, and interactions are computationally intractable -- with runtime at least quadratic in the number of covariates, and often worse. In the present work, we solve this computational bottleneck. We show that suitable interaction models have a kernel representation, namely there exists a "kernel trick" to perform variable selection and estimation in \$O\$(\# covariates) time. Our resulting fit corresponds to a sparse orthogonal decomposition of the regression function in a Hilbert space (i.e., a functional ANOVA decomposition), where interaction effects represent all variation that cannot be explained by lower-order effects. On a variety of synthetic and real datasets, our approach outperforms existing methods used for large, high-dimensional datasets while remaining competitive (or being orders of magnitude faster) in runtime.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

  abstract = {Existing analyses of neural network training often operate under the unrealistic assumption of an extremely small learning rate. This lies in stark contrast to practical wisdom and empirical studies, such as the work of J. Cohen et al. (ICLR 2021), which exhibit startling new phenomena (the "edge of stability" or "unstable convergence") and potential benefits for generalization in the large learning rate regime. Despite a flurry of recent works on this topic, however, the latter effect is still poorly understood. In this paper, we take a step towards understanding genuinely non-convex training dynamics with large learning rates by performing a detailed analysis of gradient descent for simplified models of two-layer neural networks. For these models, we provably establish the edge of stability phenomenon and discover a sharp phase transition for the step size below which the neural network fails to learn "threshold-like" neurons (i.e., neurons with a non-zero first-layer bias). This elucidates one possible mechanism by which the edge of stability can in fact lead to better generalization, as threshold neurons are basic building blocks with useful inductive bias for many tasks.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Quality control plays a major role in the analysis of ancient DNA (aDNA). One key step in this quality control is assessment of DNA damage: aDNA contains unique signatures of DNA damage that distinguish it from modern DNA, and so analyses of damage patterns can help confirm that DNA sequences obtained are from endogenous aDNA rather than from modern contamination. Predominant signatures of DNA damage include a high frequency of cytosine to thymine substitutions (C-to-T) at the ends of fragments, and elevated rates of purines (A \& G) before the 50 strand-breaks. Existing QC procedures help assess damage by simply plotting for each sample, the C-to-T mismatch rate along the read and the composition of bases before the 50 strand-breaks. Here we present a more flexible and comprehensive model-based approach to infer and visualize damage patterns in aDNA, implemented in an R package aRchaic. This approach is based on a ‘grade of membership’ model (also known as ‘admixture’ or ‘topic’ model) in which each sample has an estimated grade of membership in each of K damage profiles that are estimated from the data.},

  abstract = {High-dimensional biological data collection across heterogeneous groups of samples has become increasingly common, creating high demand for dimensionality reduction techniques that capture underlying structure of the data. Discovering low-dimensional embeddings that describe the separation of any underlying discrete latent structure in data is an important motivation for applying these techniques since these latent classes can represent important sources of unwanted variability, such as batch effects, or interesting sources of signal such as unknown cell types. The features that define this discrete latent structure are often hard to identify in high-dimensional data. Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most widely used methods as an unsupervised step for dimensionality reduction. This reduction technique finds linear transformations of the data which explain total variance. When the goal is detecting discrete structure, PCA is applied with the assumption that classes will be separated in directions of maximum variance. However, PCA will fail to accurately find discrete latent structure if this assumption does not hold. Visualization techniques, such as t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), attempt to mitigate these problems with PCA by creating a low-dimensional space where similar objects are modeled by nearby points in the low-dimensional embedding and dissimilar objects are modeled by distant points with high probability. However, since t-SNE and UMAP are computationally expensive, often a PCA reduction is done before applying them which makes it sensitive to PCAs downfalls. Also, tSNE is limited to only two or three dimensions as a visualization tool, which may not be adequate for retaining discriminatory information. The linear transformations of PCA are preferable to non-linear transformations provided by methods like t-SNE and UMAP for interpretable feature weights. Here, we propose iterative discriminant analysis (iDA), a dimensionality reduction technique designed to mitigate these limitations. iDA produces an embedding that carries discriminatory information which optimally separates latent clusters using linear transformations that permit post hoc analysis to determine features that define these latent structures.},

  abstract = {Population stratification has long been recognized as a confounding factor in genetic association studies. Estimated ancestries, derived from multi-locus genotype data, can be used to perform a statistical correction for population stratification. One popular technique for estimation of ancestry is the model-based approach embodied by the widely applied program structure. Another approach, implemented in the program EIGENSTRAT, relies on Principal Component Analysis rather than model-based estimation and does not directly deliver admixture fractions. EIGENSTRAT has gained in popularity in part owing to its remarkable speed in comparison to structure. We present a new algorithm and a program, ADMIXTURE, for model-based estimation of ancestry in unrelated individuals. ADMIXTURE adopts the likelihood model embedded in structure. However, ADMIXTURE runs considerably faster, solving problems in minutes that take structure hours. In many of our experiments, we have found that ADMIXTURE is almost as fast as EIGENSTRAT. The runtime improvements of ADMIXTURE rely on a fast block relaxation scheme using sequential quadratic programming for block updates, coupled with a novel quasi-Newton acceleration of convergence. Our algorithm also runs faster and with greater accuracy than the implementation of an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm incorporated in the program FRAPPE. Our simulations show that ADMIXTURE's maximum likelihood estimates of the underlying admixture coefficients and ancestral allele frequencies are as accurate as structure's Bayesian estimates. On real-world data sets, ADMIXTURE's estimates are directly comparable to those from structure and EIGENSTRAT. Taken together, our results show that ADMIXTURE's computational speed opens up the possibility of using a much larger set of markers in model-based ancestry estimation and that its estimates are suitable for use in correcting for population stratification in association studies.},

The evidence indicates that a minimum of five biological cases per group should be analysed. Technical replicates are rarely warranted when testing for differential expression.Modern methods (such as those used by the PowerAtlas resource) should be used for estimating the required sample size before conducting experiments.mRNA pooling can be beneficial in certain cases in which identifying differential expression is the goal.Microarray experiments should be designed to avoid confounding by extraneous factors.Many methods exist for image processing, normalization and transformation with respect to different microarray platforms. However, which preprocessing algorithms to use and under what conditions remains an area of active research.For inference in microarray experiments, test statistics for determining differential expression should consider variability; fold change does not achieve this. Test statistics that incorporate variance shrinkage are generally preferred.False-discovery-rate estimation procedures are generally recommended over family-wise error rate control procedures.Gene-class testing is encouraged when testing for differential expression.The assessment of intersections of findings when testing multiple related propositions and how to appropriately use resampling-based inference are areas for which many questions remain.Before undertaking cluster analysis, it is important to consider whether it actually addresses the question being asked and whether sufficient sample sizes can be obtained to yield reliable results.When using supervised-classification procedures, cross-validation should be carried out using data that have had no role whatsoever in the derivation of the prediction rule.Although discussed frequently in microarray research, validation of results is an area that requires further attention. When and how validation should be carried out, in addition to which criteria determine validation, are topics that remain to be addressed.},

  abstract = {Black-box machine learning learning methods are now routinely used in high-risk settings, like medical diagnostics, which demand uncertainty quantification to avoid consequential model failures. Distribution-free uncertainty quantification (distribution-free UQ) is a user-friendly paradigm for creating statistically rigorous confidence intervals/sets for such predictions. Critically, the intervals/sets are valid without distributional assumptions or model assumptions, possessing explicit guarantees even with finitely many datapoints. Moreover, they adapt to the difficulty of the input; when the input example is difficult, the uncertainty intervals/sets are large, signaling that the model might be wrong. Without much work and without retraining, one can use distribution-free methods on any underlying algorithm, such as a neural network, to produce confidence sets guaranteed to contain the ground truth with a user-specified probability, such as 90\%. Indeed, the methods are easy-to-understand and general, applying to many modern prediction problems arising in the fields of computer vision, natural language processing, deep reinforcement learning, and so on. This hands-on introduction is aimed at a reader interested in the practical implementation of distribution-free UQ who is not necessarily a statistician. We lead the reader through the practical theory and applications of distribution-free UQ, beginning with conformal prediction and culminating with distribution-free control of any risk, such as the false-discovery rate, false positive rate of out-of-distribution detection, and so on. We will include many explanatory illustrations, examples, and code samples in Python, with PyTorch syntax. The goal is to provide the reader a working understanding of distribution-free UQ, allowing them to put confidence intervals on their algorithms, with one self-contained document.},

We are motivated here by three electrical measures for the analysis of large small-world graphs G = (V, E) – i. e., graphs with diameter in O(log |V |), which are abundant in complex network analysis. From a computational point of view, the three measures have in common that their crucial component is the diagonal of the graph Laplacian’s pseudoinverse, L†. Computing diag(L†) exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix multiplication – and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time. Moreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space – hardly feasible for large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e. g., using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of O(log |V |/ 2) Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is still very expensive for large inputs.},

Our goal is to express \$M\$ as \$A W\$ where \$A\$ and \$W\$ are nonnegative matrices of size \$n \textbackslash times r\$ and \$r \textbackslash times m\$ respectively. In some applications, it makes sense to ask instead for the product \$AW\$ to approximate \$M\$ -- i.e. (approximately) minimize \$\textbackslash norm\{M - AW\}\_F\$ where \$\textbackslash norm\{\}\_F\$ denotes the Frobenius norm; we refer to this as Approximate NMF. This problem has a rich history spanning quantum mechanics, probability theory, data analysis, polyhedral combinatorics, communication complexity, demography, chemometrics, etc. In the past decade NMF has become enormously popular in machine learning, where \$A\$ and \$W\$ are computed using a variety of local search heuristics. Vavasis proved that this problem is NP-complete. We initiate a study of when this problem is solvable in polynomial time: 1. We give a polynomial-time algorithm for exact and approximate NMF for every constant \$r\$. Indeed NMF is most interesting in applications precisely when \$r\$ is small. 2. We complement this with a hardness result, that if exact NMF can be solved in time \$(nm)\^\{o(r)\}\$, 3-SAT has a sub-exponential time algorithm. This rules out substantial improvements to the above algorithm. 3. We give an algorithm that runs in time polynomial in \$n\$, \$m\$ and \$r\$ under the separablity condition identified by Donoho and Stodden in 2003. The algorithm may be practical since it is simple and noise tolerant (under benign assumptions). Separability is believed to hold in many practical settings. To the best of our knowledge, this last result is the first example of a polynomial-time algorithm that provably works under a non-trivial condition on the input and we believe that this will be an interesting and important direction for future work.},

  abstract = {Topic Modeling is an approach used for automatic comprehension and classification of data in a variety of settings, and perhaps the canonical application is in uncovering thematic structure in a corpus of documents. A number of foundational works both in machine learning and in theory have suggested a probabilistic model for documents, whereby documents arise as a convex combination of (i.e. distribution on) a small number of topic vectors, each topic vector being a distribution on words (i.e. a vector of word-frequencies). Similar models have since been used in a variety of application areas; the Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA model of Blei et al. is especially popular. Theoretical studies of topic modeling focus on learning the model's parameters assuming the data is actually generated from it. Existing approaches for the most part rely on Singular Value Decomposition(SVD), and consequently have one of two limitations: these works need to either assume that each document contains only one topic, or else can only recover the span of the topic vectors instead of the topic vectors themselves. This paper formally justifies Nonnegative Matrix Factorization(NMF) as a main tool in this context, which is an analog of SVD where all vectors are nonnegative. Using this tool we give the first polynomial-time algorithm for learning topic models without the above two limitations. The algorithm uses a fairly mild assumption about the underlying topic matrix called separability, which is usually found to hold in real-life data. A compelling feature of our algorithm is that it generalizes to models that incorporate topic-topic correlations, such as the Correlated Topic Model and the Pachinko Allocation Model. We hope that this paper will motivate further theoretical results that use NMF as a replacement for SVD - just as NMF has come to replace SVD in many applications.},

Most approaches to topic model inference have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an algorithm for topic model inference that is both provable and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while running orders of magnitude faster.},

In this study, we present the results of a large scale meta-analysis of heart failure GWAS and replication in a comparable sized cohort to identify one known and two novel loci associated with heart failure. Heart failure sub-phenotyping shows that a new locus in chromosome 1 is associated with left ventricular adverse remodeling and clinical heart failure, in response to different initial cardiac muscle insults. Functional characterization and fine-mapping of that locus reveal a putative causal variant in a cardiac muscle specific regulatory region activated during cardiomyocyte differentiation that binds to the ACTN2 gene, a crucial structural protein inside the cardiac sarcolemma (Hi-C interaction p-value\,=\,0.00002). Genome-editing in human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes confirms the influence of the identified regulatory region in the expression of ACTN2. Our findings extend our understanding of biological mechanisms underlying heart failure.},

  abstract = {Uncovering the functional impact of genetic variation on gene expression is important in understanding tissue biology and the pathogenesis of complex traits. Despite large efforts to map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) across many human tissues, our ability to translate those findings to understanding human disease has been incomplete, and the majority of disease loci are not explained by association with expression of a target gene. Cell-type specificity and the presence of multiple independent causal variants for many eQTLs are potential confounders contributing to the apparent discrepancy with disease loci. In this study, we investigate the tissue specificity of genetic effects on gene expression and the overlap with disease loci while considering the presence of multiple causal variants within and across tissues. We find evidence of pervasive tissue specificity of eQTLs, often masked by linkage disequilibrium that misleads traditional meta-analytic approaches. We propose CAFEH (colocalization and fine-mapping in the presence of allelic heterogeneity), a Bayesian method that integrates genetic association data across multiple traits, incorporating linkage disequilibrium to identify causal variants. CAFEH outperforms previous approaches in colocalization and fine-mapping. Using CAFEH, we show that genes with highly tissue-specific genetic effects are under greater selection, enriched in differentiation and developmental processes, and more likely to be involved in human disease. Last, we demonstrate that CAFEH can efficiently leverage the widespread allelic heterogeneity in genetic regulation of gene expression to prioritize the target tissue in genome-wide association complex trait loci, thereby improving our ability to interpret complex trait genetics.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new Empirical Bayes approach for large-scale hypothesis testing, including estimating false discovery rates (FDRs), and effect sizes. This approach has two key differences from existing approaches to FDR analysis. First, it assumes that the distribution of the actual (unobserved) effects is unimodal, with a mode at 0. This “unimodal assumption” (UA), although natural in many contexts, is not usually incorporated into standard FDR analysis, and we demonstrate how incorporating it brings many benefits. Specifically, the UA facilitates efficient and robust computation—estimating the unimodal distribution involves solving a simple convex optimization problem—and enables more accurate inferences provided that it holds. Second, the method takes as its input two numbers for each test (an effect size estimate and corresponding standard error), rather than the one number usually used (\$p\$ value or \$z\$ score). When available, using two numbers instead of one helps account for variation in measurement precision across tests. It also facilitates estimation of effects, and unlike standard FDR methods, our approach provides interval estimates (credible regions) for each effect in addition to measures of significance. To provide a bridge between interval estimates and significance measures, we introduce the term “local false sign rate” to refer to the probability of getting the sign of an effect wrong and argue that it is a superior measure of significance than the local FDR because it is both more generally applicable and can be more robustly estimated. Our methods are implemented in an R package ashr available from http://github.com/stephens999/ashr.},

Various learning algorithms have been developed in recent years, including collapsed Gibbs sampling, variational inference, and maximum a posteriori estimation, and this variety motivates the need for careful empirical comparisons. In this paper, we highlight the close connections between these approaches. We find that the main differences are attributable to the amount of smoothing applied to the counts. When the hyperparameters are optimized, the differences in performance among the algorithms diminish significantly. The ability of these algorithms to achieve solutions of comparable accuracy gives us the freedom to select computationally efficient approaches. Using the insights gained from this comparative study, we show how accurate topic models can be learned in several seconds on text corpora with thousands of documents.},

  abstract = {We study exact recovery conditions for convex relaxations of point cloud clustering problems, focusing on two of the most common optimization problems for unsupervised clustering: k-means and k-median clustering. Motivations for focusing on convex relaxations are: (a) they come with a certificate of optimality, and (b) they are generic tools which are relatively parameter-free, not tailored to specific assumptions over the input. More precisely, we consider the distributional setting where there are k clusters in Rm and data from each cluster consists of n points sampled from a symmetric distribution within a ball of unit radius. We ask: what is the minimal separation distance between cluster centers needed for convex relaxations to exactly recover these k clusters as the optimal integral solution? For the k-median linear programming relaxation we show a tight bound: exact recovery is obtained given arbitrarily small pairwise separation ε {$>$} O between the balls. In other words, the pairwise center separation is δ {$>$} 2+ε. Under the same distributional model, the k-means LP relaxation fails to recover such clusters at separation as large as δ = 4. Yet, if we enforce PSD constraints on the k-means LP, we get exact cluster recovery at separation as low as δ {$>$} min\{2 + √2k/m\}, 2+√2 + 2/m\vphantom\{\} + ε. In contrast, common heuristics such as Lloyd's algorithm (a.k.a. the k means algorithm) can fail to recover clusters in this setting; even with arbitrarily large cluster separation, k-means++ with overseeding by any constant factor fails with high probability at exact cluster recovery. To complement the theoretical analysis, we provide an experimental study of the recovery guarantees for these various methods, and discuss several open problems which these experiments suggest.},

BRCA1 driven triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) has been shown to arise from luminal progenitors yet little is known about how BRCA1 loss-of-function (LOF) and concomitant mutations affect the luminal progenitor cell state. Here we demonstrate how time-resolved single-cell profiling of genetically engineered mouse models before tumour formation can address this challenge. We found that perturbing Brca1/p53 in luminal progenitors induces aberrant alveolar differentiation pre-malignancy accompanied by pro-tumourigenic changes in the immune compartment. Unlike alveolar differentiation during gestation, this process is cell autonomous and characterised by the dysregulation of transcription factors driving alveologenesis. Based on our data we propose a model where Brca1/p53 LOF inadvertently promotes a differentiation program hardwired in luminal progenitors, highlighting the deterministic role of the cell-of-origin and offering a potential explanation for the tissue specificity of BRCA1 tumours.},

  abstract = {In many species, meiotic recombination events tend to occur in narrow intervals of the genome, known as hotspots. In humans and mice, double strand break (DSB) hotspot locations are determined by the DNA-binding specificity of the zinc finger array of the PRDM9 protein, which is rapidly evolving at residues in contact with DNA. Previous models explained this rapid evolution in terms of the need to restore PRDM9 binding sites lost to gene conversion over time, under the assumption that more PRDM9 binding always leads to more DSBs. In recent experimental work, however, it has become apparent that PRDM9 binding on both homologs facilitates DSB repair, and moreover that, in the absence of enough symmetric binding, meiosis no longer progresses reliably. We therefore consider the possibility that the benefit of PRDM9 stems from its role in coupling DSB formation and efficient repair. To this end, we model the evolution of PRDM9 from first principles: from its binding dynamics to the population processes that govern the evolution of the zinc finger array and its binding sites in the genome. As we show, the loss of a small number of strong binding sites leads to the use of a greater number of weaker ones, resulting in a sharp reduction in symmetric binding and favoring new PRDM9 alleles that restore the use of a smaller set of strong binding sites. This decrease in PRDM9 binding symmetry and in its ability to promote DSB repair drive the rapid zinc finger turnover. These results imply that the advantage of new PRDM9 alleles is in limiting the number of binding sites used effectively, rather than in increasing net PRDM9 binding, as previously believed. By extension, our model suggests that the evolutionary advantage of hotspots may have been to increase the efficiency of DSB repair and/or homolog pairing.},

We interrogate available functional data and discover an erythroid-specific transcription start site underlying the known~association in ATP2B4, but are unable to identify a likely causal mechanism at the chromosome 6 locus. ~Previously reported HLA associations do not replicate in these samples.~This large dataset will~provide a foundation for further research on the genetic determinants of malaria resistance in diverse populations.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are tested for disease association mostly using simple regression, one variant at a time. Standard approaches to improve power in detecting disease-associated SNPs use multiple regression with Bayesian variable selection in which a sparsity-enforcing prior on effect sizes is used to avoid overtraining and all effect sizes are integrated out for posterior inference. For binary traits, the logistic model has not yielded clear improvements over the linear model. For multi-SNP analysis, the logistic model required costly and technically challenging MCMC sampling to perform the integration. Here, we introduce the quasi-Laplace approximation to solve the integral and avoid MCMC sampling. We expect the logistic model to perform much better than multiple linear regression except when predicted disease risks are spread closely around 0.5, because only close to its inflection point can the logistic function be well approximated by a linear function. Indeed, in extensive benchmarks with simulated phenotypes and real genotypes, our Bayesian multiple LOgistic REgression method (B-LORE) showed considerable improvements (1) when regressing on many variants in multiple loci at heritabilities ≥ 0.4 and (2) for unbalanced case-control ratios. B-LORE also enables meta-analysis by approximating the likelihood functions of individual studies by multivariate normal distributions, using their means and covariance matrices as summary statistics. Our work should make sparse multiple logistic regression attractive also for other applications with binary target variables. B-LORE is freely available from: https://github.com/soedinglab/b-lore.},

In this note, we present a tutorial review of the theory of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse. We present the first definitions and some motivations, and after obtaining some basic results, we center our discussion on the spectral theorem and present an algorithmically simple expression for the computation of the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse of a given matrix. We do not claim originality of the results. We rather intend to present a complete and self-contained tutorial review, useful for those more devoted to applications, for those more theoretically oriented, and for those who already have some working knowledge of the subject.},

Gene-level association methods such as PrediXcan can prioritize candidate targets. However, limited eQTL sample sizes and absence of relevant developmental and disease context restrict our ability to detect associations. Here we propose an efficient statistical method (MultiXcan) that leverages the substantial sharing of eQTLs across tissues and contexts to improve our ability to identify potential target genes. MultiXcan integrates evidence across multiple panels using multivariate regression, which naturally takes into account the correlation structure. We apply our method to simulated and real traits from the UK Biobank and show that, in realistic settings, we can detect a larger set of significantly associated genes than using each panel separately. To improve applicability, we developed a summary result-based extension called S-MultiXcan, which we show yields highly concordant results with the individual level version when LD is well matched. Our multivariate model-based approach allowed us to use the individual level results as a gold standard to calibrate and develop a robust implementation of the summary-based extension. Results from our analysis as well as software and necessary resources to apply our method are publicly available.},

  abstract = {Integrating genome-wide association (GWAS) and expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) data into transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) based on predicted expression can boost power to detect novel disease loci or pinpoint the susceptibility gene at a known disease locus. However, it is often the case that multiple eQTL genes colocalize at disease loci, making the identification of the true susceptibility gene challenging, due to confounding through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To distinguish between true susceptibility genes (where the genetic effect on phenotype is mediated through expression) and colocalization due to LD, we examine an extension of the Mendelian Randomization Egger regression method that allows for LD while only requiring summary association data for both GWAS and eQTL. We derive the standard TWAS approach in the context of Mendelian Randomization and show in simulations that the standard TWAS does not control Type I error for causal gene identification when eQTLs have pleiotropic or LD-confounded effects on disease. In contrast, LD Aware MR-Egger regression can control Type I error in this case while attaining similar power as other methods in situations where these provide valid tests. However, when the direct effects of genetic variants on traits are correlated with the eQTL associations, all of the methods we examined including LD Aware MR-Egger regression can have inflated Type I error. We illustrate these methods by integrating gene expression within a recent large-scale breast cancer GWAS to provide guidance on susceptibility gene identification.},

  abstract = {Background Elucidation of genotype-to-phenotype relationships is a major challenge in biology. In plants, it is the basis for molecular breeding. Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) mapping enables to link variation at the trait level to variation at the genomic level. However, QTL regions typically contain tens to hundreds of genes. In order to prioritize such candidate genes, we show that we can identify potentially causal genes for a trait based on overrepresentation of biological processes (gene functions) for the candidate genes in the QTL regions of that trait. Results The prioritization method was applied to rice QTL data, using gene functions predicted on the basis of sequence- and expression-information. The average reduction of the number of genes was over ten-fold. Comparison with various types of experimental datasets (including QTL fine-mapping and Genome Wide Association Study results) indicated both statistical significance and biological relevance of the obtained connections between genes and traits. A detailed analysis of flowering time QTLs illustrates that genes with completely unknown function are likely to play a role in this important trait. Conclusions Our approach can guide further experimentation and validation of causal genes for quantitative traits. This way it capitalizes on QTL data to uncover how individual genes influence trait variation.

  abstract = {A new empirical Bayes approach to variable selection in the context of generalized linear models is developed. The proposed algorithm scales to situations in which the number of putative explanatory variables is very large, possibly much larger than the number of responses. The coefficients in the linear predictor are modeled as a three-component mixture allowing the explanatory variables to have a random positive effect on the response, a random negative effect, or no effect. A key assumption is that only a small (but unknown) fraction of the candidate variables have a nonzero effect. This assumption, in addition to treating the coefficients as random effects facilitates an approach that is computationally efficient. In particular, the number of parameters that have to be estimated is small, and remains constant regardless of the number of explanatory variables. The model parameters are estimated using a generalized alternating maximization algorithm which is scalable, and leads to significantly faster convergence compared with simulation-based fully Bayesian methods.

This paper contributes to the field by developing a novel method for mitigating their algorithmic randomness, leading to an even more interpretable and reliable framework for powerful novelty detection under false discovery rate control. The idea is to leverage suitable conformal e-values instead of p-values to quantify the significance of each finding, which allows the evidence gathered from multiple mutually dependent analyses of the same data to be seamlessly aggregated. Further, the proposed method can reduce randomness without much loss of power, partly thanks to an innovative way of weighting conformal e-values based on additional side information carefully extracted from the same data. Simulations with synthetic and real data confirm this solution can be effective at eliminating random noise in the inferences obtained with state-of-the-art alternative techniques, sometimes also leading to higher power.},

Deploying learning systems in consequential settings also requires calibrating and communicating the uncertainty of predictions. To convey instance-wise uncertainty for prediction tasks, we show how to generate set-valued predictions from a black-box predictor that control the expected loss on future test points at a user-specified level. Our approach provides explicit finite-sample guarantees for any dataset by using a holdout set to calibrate the size of the prediction sets. This framework enables simple, distribution-free, rigorous error control for many tasks, and we demonstrate it in five large-scale machine learning problems: (1) classification problems where some mistakes are more costly than others; (2) multi-label classification, where each observation has multiple associated labels; (3) classification problems where the labels have a hierarchical structure; (4) image segmentation, where we wish to predict a set of pixels containing an object of interest; and (5) protein structure prediction. Lastly, we discuss extensions to uncertainty quantification for ranking, metric learning and distributionally robust learning.},

  abstract = {Contemporary scientific research is a distributed, collaborative endeavor, carried out by teams of researchers, regulatory institutions, funding agencies, commercial partners, and scientific bodies, all interacting with each other and facing different incentives. To maintain scientific rigor, statistical methods should acknowledge this state of affairs. To this end, we study hypothesis testing when there is an agent (e.g., a researcher or a pharmaceutical company) with a private prior about an unknown parameter and a principal (e.g., a policymaker or regulator) who wishes to make decisions based on the parameter value. The agent chooses whether to run a statistical trial based on their private prior and then the result of the trial is used by the principal to reach a decision. We show how the principal can conduct statistical inference that leverages the information that is revealed by an agent's strategic behavior -- their choice to run a trial or not. In particular, we show how the principal can design a policy to elucidate partial information about the agent's private prior beliefs and use this to control the posterior probability of the null. One implication is a simple guideline for the choice of significance threshold in clinical trials: the type-I error level should be set to be strictly less than the cost of the trial divided by the firm's profit if the trial is successful.},

  abstract = {Research on environmental and genetic pathways to complex traits such as educational attainment (EA) is confounded by uncertainty over whether correlations reflect effects of transmitted parental genes, causal family environments, or some, possibly interactive, mixture of both. Thus, an aggregate of thousands of alleles associated with EA (a polygenic risk score; PRS) may tap parental behaviors and home environments promoting EA in the offspring. New methods for unpicking and determining these causal pathways are required. Here, we utilize the fact that parents pass, at random, 50\% of their genome to a given offspring to create independent scores for the transmitted alleles (conventional EA PRS) and a parental score based on alleles not transmitted to the offspring (EA VP\_PRS). The formal effect of non-transmitted alleles on offspring attainment was tested in 2,333 genotyped twins for whom high-quality measures of EA, assessed at age 17 years, were available, and whose parents were also genotyped. Four key findings were observed. First, the EA PRS and EA VP\_PRS were empirically independent, validating the virtual-parent design. Second, in this family-based design, children’s own EA PRS significantly predicted their EA (β = 0.15), ruling out stratification confounds as a cause of the association of attainment with the EA PRS. Third, parental EA PRS predicted the SES environment parents provided to offspring (β = 0.20), and parental SES and offspring EA were significantly associated (β = 0.33). This would suggest that the EA PRS is at least as strongly linked to social competence as it is to EA, leading to higher attained SES in parents and, therefore, a higher experienced SES for children. In a full structural equation model taking account of family genetic relatedness across multiple siblings the non-transmitted allele effects were estimated at similar values; but, in this more complex model, confidence intervals included zero. A test using the forthcoming EA3 PRS may clarify this outcome. The virtual-parent method may be applied to clarify causality in other phenotypes where observational evidence suggests parenting may moderate expression of other outcomes, for instance in psychiatry.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the construction of p-values for nonparametric outlier detection, taking a multiple-testing perspective. The goal is to test whether new independent samples belong to the same distribution as a reference data set or are outliers. We propose a solution based on conformal inference, a broadly applicable framework which yields p-values that are marginally valid but mutually dependent for different test points. We prove these p-values are positively dependent and enable exact false discovery rate control, although in a relatively weak marginal sense. We then introduce a new method to compute p-values that are both valid conditionally on the training data and independent of each other for different test points; this paves the way to stronger type-I error guarantees. Our results depart from classical conformal inference as we leverage concentration inequalities rather than combinatorial arguments to establish our finite-sample guarantees. Furthermore, our techniques also yield a uniform confidence bound for the false positive rate of any outlier detection algorithm, as a function of the threshold applied to its raw statistics. Finally, the relevance of our results is demonstrated by numerical experiments on real and simulated data.},

However, in high-throughput methods the portrait of each individual cell is noisy, representing thousands of the hundreds of thousands of mRNA molecules originally present. While many methods for denoising single-cell data have been proposed, a principled procedure for selecting and calibrating the best method for a given dataset has been lacking. We present “molecular cross-validation,” a statistically principled and data-driven approach for estimating the accuracy of any denoising method without the need for ground-truth. We validate this approach for three denoising methods—principal component analysis, network diffusion, and a deep autoencoder—on a dataset of deeply-sequenced neurons. We show that molecular cross-validation correctly selects the optimal parameters for each method and identifies the best method for the dataset.},

This allows us to predict the location of origin of a genetic sample by comparing it to a set of samples of known geographic origin. Here, we describe a deep learning method, which we call Locator, to accomplish this task faster and more accurately than existing approaches. In simulations, Locator infers sample location to within 4.1 generations of dispersal and runs at least an order of magnitude faster than a recent model-based approach. We leverage Locator’s computational efficiency to predict locations separately in windows across the genome, which allows us to both quantify uncertainty and describe the mosaic ancestry and patterns of geographic mixing that characterize many populations. Applied to whole-genome sequence data from Plasmodium parasites, Anopheles mosquitoes, and global human populations, this approach yields median test errors of 16.9km, 5.7km, and 85km, respectively.},

  abstract = {Understanding the consequences of regulatory variation in the human genome remains a major challenge, with important implications for understanding gene regulation and interpreting the many disease-risk variants that fall outside of protein-coding regions. Here, we provide a direct window into the regulatory consequences of genetic variation by sequencing RNA from 922 genotyped individuals. We present a comprehensive description of the distribution of regulatory variation—by the specific expression phenotypes altered, the properties of affected genes, and the genomic characteristics of regulatory variants. We detect variants influencing expression of over ten thousand genes, and through the enhanced resolution offered by RNA-sequencing, for the first time we identify thousands of variants associated with specific phenotypes including splicing and allelic expression. Evaluating the effects of both long-range intra-chromosomal and               trans               (cross-chromosomal) regulation, we observe modularity in the regulatory network, with three-dimensional chromosomal configuration playing a particular role in regulatory modules within each chromosome. We also observe a significant depletion of regulatory variants affecting central and critical genes, along with a trend of reduced effect sizes as variant frequency increases, providing evidence that purifying selection and buffering have limited the deleterious impact of regulatory variation on the cell. Further, generalizing beyond observed variants, we have analyzed the genomic properties of variants associated with expression and splicing and developed a Bayesian model to predict regulatory consequences of genetic variants, applicable to the interpretation of individual genomes and disease studies. Together, these results represent a critical step toward characterizing the complete landscape of human regulatory variation.},

  abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

The criterion can be used for nested or nonnested models and for multiple model comparison and prediction. From another perspective, the development suggests a general definition of a "reference prior" for model comparison.},

Of interest is the relationship between the P value (or observed significance level) and conditional and Bayesian measures of evidence against the null hypothesis.

  abstract = {Gene regulation in the human genome is controlled by distal enhancers that activate specific nearby promoters1. A proposed model for this specificity is that promoters have sequence-encoded preferences for certain enhancers, for example, mediated by interacting sets of transcription factors or cofactors2. This ‘biochemical compatibility’ model has been supported by observations at individual human promoters and by genome-wide measurements in Drosophila3–9. However, the degree to which human enhancers and promoters are intrinsically compatible has not yet been systematically measured, and how their activities combine to control RNA expression remains unclear. Here we design a high-throughput reporter assay called enhancer\,×\,promoter self-transcribing active regulatory region sequencing (ExP STARR-seq) and applied it to examine the combinatorial compatibilities of 1,000 enhancer and 1,000 promoter sequences in human K562 cells. We identify simple rules for enhancer–promoter compatibility, whereby most enhancers activate all promoters by similar amounts, and intrinsic enhancer and promoter activities multiplicatively combine to determine RNA output (R2\,=\,0.82). In addition, two classes of enhancers and promoters show subtle preferential effects. Promoters of housekeeping genes contain built-in activating motifs for factors such as GABPA and YY1, which decrease the responsiveness of promoters to distal enhancers. Promoters of variably expressed genes lack these motifs and show stronger responsiveness to enhancers. Together, this systematic assessment of enhancer–promoter compatibility suggests a multiplicative model tuned by enhancer and promoter class to control gene transcription in the human genome.},

Unfortunately, that understanding is confined within the mathematics of differential geometry which has limited its dissemination, especially to the applied communities for which it is particularly important. In this review I provide a comprehensive conceptual account of these theoretical foundations, focusing on developing a principled intuition behind the method and its optimal implementations rather of any exhaustive rigor. Whether a practitioner or a statistician, the dedicated reader will acquire a solid grasp of how Hamiltonian Monte Carlo works, when it succeeds, and, perhaps most importantly, when it fails.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {With increasing biobanking efforts connecting electronic health records and national registries to germline genetics, the time-to-event data analysis has attracted increasing attention in the genetics studies of human diseases. In time-to-event data analysis, the Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression model is one of the most used approaches. However, existing methods and tools are not scalable when analyzing a large biobank with hundreds of thousands of samples and endpoints, and they are not accurate when testing low-frequency and rare variants. Here, we propose a scalable and accurate method, SPACox (a saddlepoint approximation implementation based on the Cox PH regression model), that is applicable for genome-wide scale time-to-event data analysis. SPACox requires fitting a Cox PH regression model only once across the genome-wide analysis and then uses a saddlepoint approximation (SPA) to calibrate the test statistics. Simulation studies show that SPACox is 76–252 times faster than other existing alternatives, such as gwasurvivr, 185–511 times faster than the standard Wald test, and more than 6,000 times faster than the Firth correction and can control type I error rates at the genome-wide significance level regardless of minor allele frequencies. Through the analysis of UK Biobank inpatient data of 282,871 white British European ancestry samples, we show that SPACox can efficiently analyze large sample sizes and accurately control type I error rates. We identified 611 loci associated with time-to-event phenotypes of 12 common diseases, of which 38 loci would be missed within a logistic regression framework with a binary phenotype defined as event occurrence status during the follow-up period.},

However, a major barrier to the use of PRS is that the majority of GWAS come from cohorts of European ancestry. The predictive power of PRS constructed from these studies is substantially lower in non-European ancestry cohorts, although the reasons for this are unclear. To address this question, we investigate the performance of PRS for height in cohorts with admixed African and European ancestry, allowing us to evaluate ancestry-related differences in PRS predictive accuracy while controlling for environment and cohort differences. We first show that the predictive accuracy of height PRS increases linearly with European ancestry and is partially explained by European ancestry segments of the admixed genomes. We show that recombination rate, differences in allele frequencies, and differences in marginal effect sizes across ancestries all contribute to the decrease in predictive power, but none of these effects explain the decrease on its own. Finally, we demonstrate that prediction for admixed individuals can be improved by using a linear combination of PRS that includes ancestry-specific effect sizes, although this approach is at present limited by the small size of non-European ancestry discovery cohorts.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this article, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find a member of that family which is close to the target density. Closeness is measured by Kullback–Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this article is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The best results are achieved with the asymptotic Edgeworth expansion. We draw attention to the form of this expansion found by Petrov for arbitrary order of the asymptotic parameter and present a simple algorithm realizing Petrov’s prescription for the Edgeworth expansion.

  abstract = {Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate (FDR) is one of the most commonly used approaches for measuring and controlling error rates when performing multiple tests. Adaptive FDRs rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here, we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in FDR estimator. We apply our method to a genome-wise association meta-analysis for body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios. We provide an implementation of this novel method for estimating the proportion of null hypotheses in a regression framework as part of the Bioconductor package swfdr.},

  abstract = {Modern scientific studies from many diverse areas of research abound with multiple hypothesis testing concerns. The false discovery rate (FDR) is one of the most commonly used approaches for measuring and controlling error rates when performing multiple tests. Adaptive FDRs rely on an estimate of the proportion of null hypotheses among all the hypotheses being tested. This proportion is typically estimated once for each collection of hypotheses. Here, we propose a regression framework to estimate the proportion of null hypotheses conditional on observed covariates. This may then be used as a multiplication factor with the Benjamini–Hochberg adjusted p-values, leading to a plug-in FDR estimator. We apply our method to a genome-wise association meta-analysis for body mass index. In our framework, we are able to use the sample sizes for the individual genomic loci and the minor allele frequencies as covariates. We further evaluate our approach via a number of simulation scenarios. We provide an implementation of this novel method for estimating the proportion of null hypotheses in a regression framework as part of the Bioconductor package swfdr.},

A number of recent developments aim to address this with extensions based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) strategies. We build on this here, introducing an ABC SMC method that uses data-based adaptive weights.

  abstract = {The observation of genetic correlations between disparate human traits has been interpreted as evidence of widespread pleiotropy. Here, we introduce cross-trait assortative mating (xAM) as an alternative explanation. We observe that xAM affects many phenotypes and that phenotypic cross-mate correlation estimates are strongly associated with genetic correlation estimates (               R               2               = 74\%). We demonstrate that existing xAM plausibly accounts for substantial fractions of genetic correlation estimates and that previously reported genetic correlation estimates between some pairs of psychiatric disorders are congruent with xAM alone. Finally, we provide evidence for a history of xAM at the genetic level using cross-trait even/odd chromosome polygenic score correlations. Together, our results demonstrate that previous reports have likely overestimated the true genetic similarity between many phenotypes.                        ,              Nonrandom selection                            Many studies have examined correlations between complex traits, assuming that correlations implied a genetic connection even when there was no clear biological overlap. It had been proposed that overlapping genes with pleiotropic effects contribute to multiple different psychiatric disorders or even across disease categories such as psychiatric and metabolic conditions. By combining analysis of phenotype data from two large, population-based cohorts with in silico simulations, Border               et al               . demonstrated that many correlations between human traits can be explained instead by cross-trait assortative mating, which is an individual’s tendency to choose a mate with specific characteristics that have no genetic relationship (see the Perspective by Grotzinger and Keller). —YN                        ,              Some correlations between human traits can be explained by cross-trait assortative mating and not purely genetics.},

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

  abstract = {Background: The number of Mendelian randomization analyses including large numbers of genetic variants is rapidly increasing. This is due to the proliferation of genome-wide association studies, and the desire to obtain more precise estimates of causal effects. However, some genetic variants may not be valid instrumental variables, in particular due to them having more than one proximal phenotypic correlate (pleiotropy). Methods: We view Mendelian randomization with multiple instruments as a meta-analysis, and show that bias caused by pleiotropy can be regarded as analogous to small study bias. Causal estimates using each instrument can be displayed visually by a funnel plot to assess potential asymmetry. Egger regression, a tool to detect small study bias in meta-analysis, can be adapted to test for bias from pleiotropy, and the slope coefficient from Egger regression provides an estimate of the causal effect. Under the assumption that the association of each genetic variant with the exposure is independent of the pleiotropic effect of the variant (not via the exposure), Egger’s test gives a valid test of the null causal hypothesis and a consistent causal effect estimate even when all the genetic variants are invalid instrumental variables. Results: We illustrate the use of this approach by re-analysing two published Mendelian randomization studies of the causal effect of height on lung function, and the causal effect of blood pressure on coronary artery disease risk. The conservative nature of this approach is illustrated with these examples. Conclusions: An adaption of Egger regression (which we call MR-Egger) can detect some violations of the standard instrumental variable assumptions, and provide an effect estimate which is not subject to these violations. The approach provides a sensitivity analysis for the robustness of the findings from a Mendelian randomization investigation.},

Intuitively, one might expect disease-causing variants to cluster into key pathways that drive disease etiology.

We propose that gene regulatory networks are sufficiently interconnected such that all genes expressed in disease-relevant cells are liable to affect the functions of core disease-related genes and that most heritability can be explained by effects on genes outside core pathways. We refer to this hypothesis as an “omnigenic” model.},

Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.},

A new line of work reformulates this problem as a continuous constrained optimization one, which is solved via the augmented Lagrangian method. However, most methods based on this idea do not make use of interventional data, which can significantly alleviate identifiability issues. This work constitutes a new step in this direction by proposing a theoretically-grounded method based on neural networks that can leverage interventional data. We illustrate the flexibility of the continuous-constrained framework by taking advantage of expressive neural architectures such as normalizing flows. We show that our approach compares favorably to the state of the art in a variety of settings, including perfect and imperfect interventions for which the targeted nodes may even be unknown.},

Here we describe methods for within-family Mendelian randomization analyses and use simulation studies to show that family-based analyses can reduce such biases. We illustrate empirically how familial effects can affect estimates using data from 61,008 siblings from the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study and UK Biobank and replicated our findings using 222,368 siblings from 23andMe. Both Mendelian randomization estimates using unrelated individuals and within family methods reproduced established effects of lower BMI reducing risk of diabetes and high blood pressure. However, while Mendelian randomization estimates from samples of unrelated individuals suggested that taller height and lower BMI increase educational attainment, these effects were strongly attenuated in within-family Mendelian randomization analyses. Our findings indicate the necessity of controlling for population structure and familial effects in Mendelian randomization studies.},

  abstract = {With the rise of both the number and the complexity of traits of interest, control of the false discovery rate (FDR) in genetic association studies has become an increasingly appealing and accepted target for multiple comparison adjustment. While a number of robust FDR-controlling strategies exist, the nature of this error rate is intimately tied to the precise way in which discoveries are counted, and the performance of FDR-controlling procedures is satisfactory only if there is a one-to-one correspondence between what scientists describe as unique discoveries and the number of rejected hypotheses. The presence of linkage disequilibrium between markers in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) often leads researchers to consider the signal associated to multiple neighboring SNPs as indicating the existence of a single genomic locus with possible influence on the phenotype. This a posteriori aggregation of rejected hypotheses results in inflation of the relevant FDR. We propose a novel approach to FDR control that is based on prescreening to identify the level of resolution of distinct hypotheses. We show how FDR-controlling strategies can be adapted to account for this initial selection both with theoretical results and simulations that mimic the dependence structure to be expected in GWAS. We demonstrate that our approach is versatile and useful when the data are analyzed using both tests based on single markers and multiple regression. We provide an R package that allows practitioners to apply our procedure on standard GWAS format data, and illustrate its performance on lipid traits in the North Finland Birth Cohort 66 cohort study.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) researchers have been developing and refining large language models (LLMs) that exhibit remarkable capabilities across a variety of domains and tasks, challenging our understanding of learning and cognition. The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

Like other boosting algorithms, L2Boost uses many times in an iterative fashion a prechosen fitting method, called the learner. Based on the explicit expression of refitting of residuals of L2Boost, the case with (symmetric) linear learners is studied in detail in both regression and classification. In particular, with the boosting iteration m working as the smoothing or regularization parameter, a new exponential bias-variance trade-off is found with the variance (complexity) term increasing very slowly as m tends to infinity. When the learner is a smoothing spline, an optimal rate of convergence result holds for both regression and classification and the boosted smoothing spline even adapts to higher-order, unknown smoothness. Moreover, a simple expansion of a (smoothed) 0–1 loss function is derived to reveal the importance of the decision boundary, bias reduction, and impossibility of an additive bias-variance decomposition in classification. Finally, simulation and real dataset results are obtained to demonstrate the attractiveness of L2Boost. In particular, we demonstrate that L2Boosting with a novel component-wise cubic smoothing spline is both practical and effective in the presence of high-dimensional predictors.},

  abstract = {Background An allele score is a single variable summarizing multiple genetic variants associated with a risk factor. It is calculated as the total number of risk factor-increasing alleles for an individual (unweighted score), or the sum of weights for each allele corresponding to estimated genetic effect sizes (weighted score). An allele score can be used in a Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate the causal effect of the risk factor on an outcome. Methods Data were simulated to investigate the use of allele scores in Mendelian randomization where conventional instrumental variable techniques using multiple genetic variants demonstrate ‘weak instrument’ bias. The robustness of estimates using the allele score to misspecification (for example non-linearity, effect modification) and to violations of the instrumental variable assumptions was assessed. Results Causal estimates using a correctly specified allele score were unbiased with appropriate coverage levels. The estimates were generally robust to misspecification of the allele score, but not to instrumental variable violations, even if the majority of variants in the allele score were valid instruments. Using a weighted rather than an unweighted allele score increased power, but the increase was small when genetic variants had similar effect sizes. Naive use of the data under analysis to choose which variants to include in an allele score, or for deriving weights, resulted in substantial biases. Conclusions Allele scores enable valid causal estimates with large numbers of genetic variants. The stringency of criteria for genetic variants in Mendelian randomization should be maintained for all variants in an allele score.},

  abstract = {Finding individual-level data for adequately-powered Mendelian randomization analyses may be problematic. As publicly-available summarized data on genetic associations with disease outcomes from large consortia are becoming more abundant, use of published data is an attractive analysis strategy for obtaining precise estimates of the causal effects of risk factors on outcomes. We detail the necessary steps for conducting Mendelian randomization investigations using published data, and present novel statistical methods for combining data on the associations of multiple (correlated or uncorrelated) genetic variants with the risk factor and outcome into a single causal effect estimate. A two-sample analysis strategy may be employed, in which evidence on the gene-risk factor and gene-outcome associations are taken from different data sources. These approaches allow the efficient identification of risk factors that are suitable targets for clinical intervention from published data, although the ability to assess the assumptions necessary for causal inference is diminished. Methods and guidance are illustrated using the example of the causal effect of serum calcium levels on fasting glucose concentrations. The estimated causal effect of a 1 standard deviation (0.13~mmol/L) increase in calcium levels on fasting glucose (mM) using a single lead variant from the CASR gene region is 0.044 (95~\% credible interval −0.002, 0.100). In contrast, using our method to account for the correlation between variants, the corresponding estimate using 17 genetic variants is 0.022 (95~\% credible interval 0.009, 0.035), a more clearly positive causal effect.},

This problem is especially difficult without any parametric assumptions on the data.

We propose a general framework that first fits nonparametric machine learning regression algorithms on  𝑌|𝑍 𝑌 | 𝑍  and  𝑌|(𝑋,𝑍) 𝑌 | ( 𝑋 , 𝑍 ) , then compares the prediction power of the two models.

The P value for the test can be easily obtained by permutation. In simulations, we find that the proposed method is more powerful compared to existing methods. The proposed method allows us to draw biologically meaningful conclusions from two gene expression data analyses without strong distributional assumptions: 1) testing the prediction power of sequencing RNA for the proteins in cellular indexing of transcriptomes and epitopes by sequencing data and 2) identification of spatially variable genes in spatially resolved transcriptomics data.},

This problem exhibits some features that are significantly different from those that occur in estimating conventional smooth functionals. This is a setting where standard techniques fail to yield sharp results. A sharp minimax lower bound is established by applying the general lower bound technique based on testing two composite hypotheses. A key step is the construction of two special priors and bounding the chi-square distance between two normal mixtures. An estimator is constructed using approximation theory and Hermite polynomials and is shown to be asymptotically sharp minimax when the means are bounded by a given value M. It is shown that the minimax risk equals β∗2M2(log log n/log n)2 asymptotically, where β∗ is the Bernstein constant.

  abstract = {Previous studies have prioritized trait-relevant cell types by looking for an enrichment of genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal within functional regions. However, these studies are limited in cell resolution by the lack of functional annotations from difficult-to-characterize or rare cell populations. Measurement of single-cell gene expression has become a popular method for characterizing novel cell types, and yet limited work has linked single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to phenotypes of interest. To address this deficiency, we present RolyPoly, a regression-based polygenic model that can prioritize trait-relevant cell types and genes from GWAS summary statistics and gene expression data. RolyPoly is designed to use expression data from either bulk tissue or single-cell RNA-seq. In this study, we demonstrated RolyPoly’s accuracy through simulation and validated previously known tissue-trait associations. We discovered a significant association between microglia and late-onset Alzheimer disease and an association between schizophrenia and oligodendrocytes and replicating fetal cortical cells. Additionally, RolyPoly computes a trait-relevance score for each gene to reflect the importance of expression specific to a cell type. We found that differentially expressed genes in the prefrontal cortex of individuals with Alzheimer disease were significantly enriched with genes ranked highly by RolyPoly gene scores. Overall, our method represents a powerful framework for understanding the effect of common variants on cell types contributing to complex traits.},

  abstract = {Competitive gene set tests are commonly used in molecular pathway analysis to test for enrichment of a particular gene annotation category amongst the differential expression results from a microarray experiment. Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

To address these shortcomings we develop Hilbert coresets, i.e., Bayesian coresets constructed under a norm induced by an inner-product on the log-likelihood function space. We propose two Hilbert coreset construction algorithms—one based on importance sampling, and one based on the Frank-Wolfe algorithm—along with theoretical guarantees on approximation quality as a function of coreset size. Since the exact computation of the proposed inner-products is model-specific, we automate the construction with a random finite-dimensional projection of the log-likelihood functions.

But modern algorithms for approximate Bayesian posterior inference often sacrifice accurate posterior uncertainty estimation in the pursuit of scalability. This work shows that previous Bayesian coreset construction algorithms---which build a small, weighted subset of the data that approximates the full dataset---are no exception. We demonstrate that these algorithms scale the coreset log-likelihood suboptimally, resulting in underestimated posterior uncertainty. To address this shortcoming, we develop greedy iterative geodesic ascent (GIGA), a novel algorithm for Bayesian coreset construction that scales the coreset log-likelihood optimally. GIGA provides geometric decay in posterior approximation error as a function of coreset size, and maintains the fast running time of its predecessors. The paper concludes with validation of GIGA on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating that it reduces posterior approximation error by orders of magnitude compared with previous coreset constructions.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of automated inference algorithms in Bayesian statistics has provided practitioners newfound access to fast, reproducible data analysis and powerful statistical models. Designing automated methods that are also both computationally scalable and theoretically sound, however, remains a significant challenge. Recent work on Bayesian coresets takes the approach of compressing the dataset before running a standard inference algorithm, providing both scalability and guarantees on posterior approximation error. But the automation of past coreset methods is limited because they depend on the availability of a reasonable coarse posterior approximation, which is difficult to specify in practice. In the present work we remove this requirement by formulating coreset construction as sparsity-constrained variational inference within an exponential family. This perspective leads to a novel construction via greedy optimization, and also provides a unifying information-geometric view of present and past methods. The proposed Riemannian coreset construction algorithm is fully automated, requiring no problem-specific inputs aside from the probabilistic model and dataset. In addition to being significantly easier to use than past methods, experiments demonstrate that past coreset constructions are fundamentally limited by the fixed coarse posterior approximation; in contrast, the proposed algorithm is able to continually improve the coreset, providing state-of-the-art Bayesian dataset summarization with orders-of-magnitude reduction in KL divergence to the exact posterior.},

  abstract = {Many contemporary large-scale applications involve building interpretable models linking a large set of potential covariates to a response in a nonlinear fashion, such as when the response is binary. Although this modeling problem has been extensively studied, it remains unclear how to effectively control the fraction of false discoveries even in high-dimensional logistic regression, not to mention general highdimensional nonlinear models. To address such a practical problem, we propose a new framework of model-X knockoffs, which reads from a different perspective the knockoff procedure (Barber and Cand`es, 2015) originally designed for controlling the false discovery rate in linear models. Whereas the knockoffs procedure is constrained to homoscedastic linear models with n ≥ p, the key innovation here is that model-X knockoffs provide valid inference from finite samples in settings in which the conditional distribution of the response is arbitrary and completely unknown. Furthermore, this holds no matter the number of covariates. Correct inference in such a broad setting is achieved by constructing knockoff variables probabilistically instead of geometrically. To do this, our approach requires the covariates be random (independent and identically distributed rows) with a distribution that is known, although we provide preliminary experimental evidence that our procedure is robust to unknown/estimated distributions. To our knowledge, no other procedure solves the controlled variable selection problem in such generality, but in the restricted settings where competitors exist, we demonstrate the superior power of knockoffs through simulations. Finally, we apply our procedure to data from a case-control study of Crohn’s disease in the United Kingdom, making twice as many discoveries as the original analysis of the same data.},

Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components               exactly               by solving a very convenient convex program called               Principal Component Pursuit               ; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the ℓ               1               norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully mapped thousands of loci associated with complex traits. These associations could reveal the molecular mechanisms altered in common complex diseases and result in the identification of novel drug targets. However, GWAS have also left a number of outstanding questions. In particular, the majority of disease-associated loci lie in non-coding regions of the genome and, even though they are thought to play a role in gene expression regulation, it is unclear which genes they regulate and in which cell types or physiological contexts this regulation occurs. This has hindered the translation of GWAS findings into clinical interventions. In this review we summarize how these challenges have been addressed over the last decade, with a particular focus on the integration of GWAS results with functional genomics datasets. Firstly, we investigate how the tissues and cell types involved in diseases can be identified using methods that test for enrichment of GWAS variants in genomic annotations. Secondly, we explore how to find the genes regulated by GWAS loci using methods that test for colocalization of GWAS signals with molecular phenotypes such as quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Finally, we highlight potential future research avenues such as integrating GWAS results with single-cell sequencing read-outs, designing functionally informed polygenic risk scores (PRS), and validating disease associated genes using genetic engineering. These tools will be crucial to identify new drug targets for common complex diseases.},

  abstract = {Pathway analyses of genome-wide association studies aggregate information over sets of related genes, such as genes in common pathways, to identify gene sets that are enriched for variants associated with disease. We develop a model-based approach to pathway analysis, and apply this approach to data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) studies. Our method offers several benefits over existing approaches. First, our method not only interrogates pathways for enrichment of disease associations, but also estimates the level of enrichment, which yields a coherent way to promote variants in enriched pathways, enhancing discovery of genes underlying disease. Second, our approach allows for multiple enriched pathways, a feature that leads to novel findings in two diseases where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a major determinant of disease susceptibility. Third, by modeling disease as the combined effect of multiple markers, our method automatically accounts for linkage disequilibrium among variants. Interrogation of pathways from eight pathway databases yields strong support for enriched pathways, indicating links between Crohn's disease (CD) and cytokine-driven networks that modulate immune responses; between rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and “Measles” pathway genes involved in immune responses triggered by measles infection; and between type 1 diabetes (T1D) and IL2-mediated signaling genes. Prioritizing variants in these enriched pathways yields many additional putative disease associations compared to analyses without enrichment. For CD and RA, 7 of 8 additional non-MHC associations are corroborated by other studies, providing validation for our approach. For T1D, prioritization of IL-2 signaling genes yields strong evidence for 7 additional non-MHC candidate disease loci, as well as suggestive evidence for several more. Of the 7 strongest associations, 4 are validated by other studies, and 3 (near IL-2 signaling genes RAF1, MAPK14, and FYN) constitute novel putative T1D loci for further study.},

Using simulations, we compare performance with commonly used fine-mapping methods, including fastPAINTOR and SuSiE, and show that the proposed model has smaller credible sets with high power when using in-sample LD, and lower FDR/higher precision and higher coverage for credible sets when using external LD.

  abstract = {Allelic expression analysis has become important for integrating genome and transcriptome data to characterize various biological phenomena such as cis-regulatory variation and nonsense-mediated decay. We analyze the properties of allelic expression read count data and technical sources of error, such as low-quality or double-counted RNA-seq reads, genotyping errors, allelic mapping bias, and technical covariates due to sample preparation and sequencing, and variation in total read depth. We provide guidelines for correcting such errors, show that our quality control measures improve the detection of relevant allelic expression, and introduce tools for the high-throughput production of allelic expression data from RNA-sequencing data.},

We consider the posterior distribution in the frequentist set-up that the observations are generated according to a fixed mean vector, and are interested in the posterior distribution of the number of nonzero components and the contraction of the posterior distribution to the true mean vector. We find various combinations of priors on the number of nonzero coefficients and on these coefficients that give desirable performance. We also find priors that give suboptimal convergence, for instance, Gaussian priors on the nonzero coefficients. We illustrate the results by simulations.},

To generate this map, we developed a probabilistic framework that integrates cell- or tissue-specific experimental data such as histone modifications and DNase I cleavage patterns with genomic information such as gene annotation and evolutionary conservation. Comparison to empirical ChIP-seq data suggests that our method is highly accurate yet has the advantage of targeting many factors in a single assay.

  abstract = {Gaussian process prior with an appropriate likelihood function is a flexible non-parametric model for a variety of learning tasks. One important and standard task is multi-class classification, which is the categorization of an item into one of several fixed classes. A usual likelihood function for this is the multinomial logistic likelihood function. However, exact inference with this model has proved to be difficult because high-dimensional integrations are required. In this paper, we propose a variational approximation to this model, and we describe the optimization of the variational parameters. Experiments have shown our approximation to be tight. In addition, we provide dataindependent bounds on the marginal likelihood of the model, one of which is shown to be much tighter than the existing variational mean-field bound in the experiments. We also derive a proper lower bound on the predictive likelihood that involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the approximating and the true posterior. We combine our approach with a recently proposed sparse approximation to give a variational sparse approximation to the Gaussian process multi-class model. We also derive criteria which can be used to select the inducing set, and we show the effectiveness of these criteria over random selection in an experiment.},

For a large class of models we explicitly relate the two approaches, showing that the local variational method is equivalent to a weakened form of Kullback-Leibler Gaussian approximation.  This gives a strong motivation to develop efficient methods for  KL minimisation.  An important and previously unproven property of the KL variational Gaussian bound is that it is a concave function in the parameters of the Gaussian for log concave sites. This observation, along with compact concave parametrisations of the covariance, enables us to develop fast scalable optimisation procedures to obtain lower bounds on the marginal likelihood in large scale Bayesian linear models.},

Our method refines the adaptive p-value thresholding (AdaPT) procedure by generalizing its masking scheme to reduce the bias and variance of its false discovery proportion estimator, improving the power when the rejection set is small or some null p-values concentrate near 1. We also introduce a Gaussian mixture model for the conditional distribution of the test statistics given covariates, modeling the mixing proportions with a generic user-specified classifier, which we implement using a two-layer neural network. Like AdaPT, our method provably controls the FDR in finite samples even if the classifier or the Gaussian mixture model is misspecified. We show in extensive simulations and real data examples that our new method, which we call AdaPT-GMM, consistently delivers high power relative to competing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, it performs well in scenarios where AdaPT is underpowered, and is especially well-suited for testing composite null hypothesis, such as whether the effect size exceeds a practical significance threshold.},

Then (y0, a0), along with the covariate matrix X of the current study, are used to specify the conjugate prior for the regression coefficients β in a generalized linear model.

They also have the advantage of using only the marginal test statistics and the correlation among SNPs. Both methods leverage the fact that the marginal test statistics asymptotically follow a multivariate normal distribution and are likelihood based. However, their relationship with Bayesian fine mapping, such as BIMBAM, is not clear. In this study, we first show that CAVIAR and BIMBAM are actually approximately equivalent to each other. This leads to a fine-mapping method using marginal test statistics in the Bayesian framework, which we call CAVIAR Bayes factor (CAVIARBF). Another advantage of the Bayesian framework is that it can answer both association and fine-mapping questions. We also used simulations to compare CAVIARBF with other methods under different numbers of causal variants. The results showed that both CAVIARBF and BIMBAM have better performance than PAINTOR and other methods. Compared to BIMBAM, CAVIARBF has the advantage of using only marginal test statistics and takes about one-quarter to onefifth of the running time. We applied different methods on two independent cohorts of the same phenotype. Results showed that CAVIARBF, BIMBAM, and PAINTOR selected the same top 3 SNPs; however, CAVIARBF and BIMBAM had better consistency in selecting the top 10 ranked SNPs between the two cohorts.

For a given test, the informative variable provides information about the prior probability a null hypothesis is true or the power of that particular test. The FDR is then treated as a function of this informative variable. We consider two applications in genomics. Our first application is a genetics of gene expression (eQTL) experiment in yeast where every genetic marker and gene expression trait pair are tested for associations. The informative variable in this case is the distance between each genetic marker and gene. Our second application is to detect differentially expressed genes in an RNA-seq study carried out in mice. The informative variable in this study is the per-gene read depth. The framework we develop is quite general, and it should be useful in a broad range of scientific applications.},

Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate our method’s ability to produce calibrated posterior summaries such as credible sets and posterior inclusion probabilities, particularly for traits with genetic architectures that have significant proportions of non-additive variation driven by correlated variants.

The method presented here is not intended to replace the existing special models available for a covariance matrix, but rather to provide a broad range of further structures that supplements existing methodology. Maximum likelihood estimation procedures are used to estimate the parameters, and the large-sample asymptotic properties are obtained. A simulation study and two real-life examples are given to illustrate the method introduced.},

Polson, Scott, and Windle (2013) recently introduced an analogous algorithm for Bayesian logistic regression. The main difference between the two is that Albert and Chib’s (1993) truncated normals are replaced by so-called Polya-Gamma random variables. In this note, we establish that the Markov chain underlying Polson, Scott, and Windle’s (2013) algorithm is uniformly ergodic. This theoretical result has important practical benefits. In particular, it guarantees the existence of central limit theorems that can be used to make an informed decision about how long the simulation should be run.},

Here we developed BayesPrism, a Bayesian method to jointly predict cellular composition and gene expression in each cell type, including heterogeneous malignant cells, from bulk RNA-seq using scRNA-seq as prior information. We conducted an integrative analysis of 1,412 bulk RNA-seq samples in primary glioblastoma, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma using single-cell datasets of 85 patients. We identified cell types correlated with clinical outcomes and explored spatial heterogeneity in tumor state and stromal composition. We refined subtypes using gene expression in malignant cells, after excluding confounding non-malignant cell types. Finally, we identified genes whose expression in malignant cells correlated with infiltration of macrophages, T cells, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells across multiple tumor types. Our work introduces a new lens that uses scRNA-seq to accurately infer cellular composition and expression in large cohorts of bulk data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

In this paper, we review the basic properties of proximity operators which are relevant to signal processing and present optimization methods based on these operators. These proximal splitting methods are shown to capture and extend several well-known algorithms in a unifying framework. Applications of proximal methods in signal recovery and synthesis are discussed.},

Here we present Cell-ID, a clustering-free multivariate statistical method for the robust extraction of per-cell gene signatures from single-cell sequencing data. We applied Cell-ID to data from multiple human and mouse samples, including blood cells, pancreatic islets and airway, intestinal and olfactory epithelium, as well as to comprehensive mouse cell atlas datasets. We demonstrate that Cell-ID signatures are reproducible across different donors, tissues of origin, species and single-cell omics technologies, and can be used for automatic cell-type annotation and cell matching across datasets. Cell-ID improves biological interpretation at individual cell level, enabling discovery of previously uncharacterized rare cell types or cell states.

  abstract = {Epistasis, commonly defined as the interaction between multiple genes, is an important genetic component underlying phenotypic variation. Many statistical methods have been developed to model and identify epistatic interactions between genetic variants. However, because of the large combinatorial search space of interactions, most epistasis mapping methods face enormous computational challenges and often suffer from low statistical power due to multiple test correction. Here, we present a novel, alternative strategy for mapping epistasis: instead of directly identifying individual pairwise or higher-order interactions, we focus on mapping variants that have non-zero marginal epistatic effects—the combined pairwise interaction effects between a given variant and all other variants. By testing marginal epistatic effects, we can identify candidate variants that are involved in epistasis without the need to identify the exact partners with which the variants interact, thus potentially alleviating much of the statistical and computational burden associated with standard epistatic mapping procedures. Our method is based on a variance component model, and relies on a recently developed variance component estimation method for efficient parameter inference and p-value computation. We refer to our method as the “MArginal ePIstasis Test”, or MAPIT. With simulations, we show how MAPIT can be used to estimate and test marginal epistatic effects, produce calibrated test statistics under the null, and facilitate the detection of pairwise epistatic interactions. We further illustrate the benefits of MAPIT in a QTL mapping study by analyzing the gene expression data of over 400 individuals from the GEUVADIS consortium.},

  abstract = {Randomized coordinate descent (RCD) methods are state-of-the-art algorithms for training linear predictors via minimizing regularized empirical risk. When the number of examples (\$n\$) is much larger than the number of features (\$d\$), a common strategy is to apply RCD to the dual problem. On the other hand, when the number of features is much larger than the number of examples, it makes sense to apply RCD directly to the primal problem. In this paper we provide the first joint study of these two approaches when applied to L2-regularized ERM. First, we show through a rigorous analysis that for dense data, the above intuition is precisely correct. However, we find that for sparse and structured data, primal RCD can significantly outperform dual RCD even if \$d \textbackslash ll n\$, and vice versa, dual RCD can be much faster than primal RCD even if \$n \textbackslash ll d\$. Moreover, we show that, surprisingly, a single sampling strategy minimizes both the (bound on the) number of iterations and the overall expected complexity of RCD. Note that the latter complexity measure also takes into account the average cost of the iterations, which depends on the structure and sparsity of the data, and on the sampling strategy employed. We confirm our theoretical predictions using extensive experiments with both synthetic and real data sets.},

  abstract = {Fine-mapping aims to identify causal genetic variants for phenotypes. Bayesian fine-mapping algorithms (for example, SuSiE, FINEMAP, ABF and COJO-ABF) are widely used, but assessing posterior probability calibration remains challenging in real data, where model misspecification probably exists, and true causal variants are unknown. We introduce replication failure rate (RFR), a metric to assess fine-mapping consistency by downsampling. SuSiE, FINEMAP and COJO-ABF show high RFR, indicating potential overconfidence in their output. Simulations reveal that nonsparse genetic architecture can lead to miscalibration, while imputation noise, nonuniform distribution of causal variants and quality control filters have minimal impact. Here we present SuSiE-inf and FINEMAP-inf, fine-mapping methods modeling infinitesimal effects alongside fewer larger causal effects. Our methods show improved calibration, RFR and functional enrichment, competitive recall and computational efficiency. Notably, using our methods’ posterior effect sizes substantially increases polygenic risk score accuracy over SuSiE and FINEMAP. Our work improves causal variant identification for complex traits, a fundamental goal of human genetics.},

  abstract = {Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) enables characterizing the cellular heterogeneity in human tissues. Technological advances have enabled the first population-scale scRNA-seq studies in hundreds of individuals, allowing to assay genetic effects with single-cell resolution. However, existing strategies to perform genetic analyses using scRNA-seq remain based on principles established for bulk RNA-seq. In particular, current methods depend on a priori definitions of discrete cell types, and hence cannot assess allelic effects across subtle cell types and cell states. To address this, we propose Cell Regulatory Map (CellRegMap), a statistical framework to test for and quantify genetic effects on gene expression in individual cells. CellRegMap provides a principled approach to identify and characterize heterogeneity in allelic effects across cellular contexts of different granularity, including cell subtypes and continuous cell transitions. We validate CellRegMap using simulated data and apply it to two recent studies of differentiating iPSCs, where we uncover a previously underappreciated heterogeneity of genetic effects across cellular contexts. Finally, we identify fine-grained genetic regulation in neuronal subtypes for eQTL that are colocalized with human disease variants.},

However, unbiased methods to profile GxE genome-wide are nascent and, as we show, cannot accommodate general environment variables, modest sample sizes, heterogeneous noise, and binary traits. To address this gap, we propose a simple, unifying mixed model for gene-environment interaction (GxEMM). In simulations and theory, we show that GxEMM can dramatically improve estimates and eliminate false positives when the assumptions of existing methods fail. We apply GxEMM to a range of human and model organism datasets and find broad evidence of context-specific genetic effects, including GxSex, GxAdversity, and GxDisease interactions across thousands of clinical and molecular phenotypes. Overall, GxEMM is broadly applicable for testing and quantifying polygenic interactions, which can be useful for explaining heritability and invaluable for determining biologically relevant environments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: P. falciparum malaria has been recognized as one of the prominent evolutionary selective forces of human genome that led to the emergence of multiple host protective alleles. A comprehensive understanding of the genetic bases of severe~malaria susceptibility and~resistance can potentially pave ways to the development of new therapeutics and vaccines. Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have recently been implemented in malaria endemic areas and identified a number of novel association genetic variants. However, there are several open questions around heritability, epistatic interactions, genetic correlations and associated molecular pathways among others. Here, we assess the progress and pitfalls of severe malaria susceptibility GWASs and discuss the~biology of the novel variants. RESULTS: We obtained all severe malaria susceptibility GWASs published thus far and accessed GWAS dataset of Gambian populations from European Phenome Genome Archive (EGA) through the MalariaGen consortium standard data access protocols. We noticed that, while some of the well-known variants including HbS and ABO blood group were replicated across endemic populations, only few novel variants were convincingly identified and their biological functions remain to be understood. We estimated SNP-heritability of severe malaria at 20.1\% in Gambian populations and showed how advanced statistical genetic analytic methods can potentially be implemented in malaria susceptibility studies to provide useful functional insights. CONCLUSIONS: The ultimate goal of malaria susceptibility study is to discover a novel causal biological pathway that provide protections against severe malaria; a fundamental step towards translational medicine such as development of vaccine and new therapeutics. Beyond singe locus analysis, the future direction of malaria susceptibility requires a paradigm shift from single -omics to multi-stage and multi-dimensional integrative functional studies that combines multiple data types from the human host, the parasite, the mosquitoes and the environment. The current biotechnological and statistical advances may eventually lead to the feasibility of systems biology studies and revolutionize malaria research.},

We further applied rare variant analysis to raw GWAS datasets (N = 11,000) of three malaria endemic populations including Kenya, Malawi, and Gambia and performed various population genetic structures of the identified genes in the three populations and global populations. We performed network and pathway analyses to investigate their shared biological functions. Our functional mapping analysis identified 57 genes located in the known malaria genomic loci, while our gene-based GWAS analysis identified additional 125 genes across the genome. The identified genes were significantly enriched in malaria pathogenic pathways including multiple overlapping pathways in erythrocyte-related functions, blood coagulations, ion channels, adhesion molecules, membrane signalling elements, and neuronal systems. Our population genetic analysis revealed that the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) residing in the identified genes are generally higher in the three malaria endemic populations compared to global populations. Overall, our results suggest that severe malaria resistance trait is attributed to multiple genes, highlighting the possibility of harnessing new malaria therapeutics that can simultaneously target multiple malaria protective host molecular pathways.},

  abstract = {In this article, we study a generalization of the two-groups model in the presence of covariates—a problem that has recently received much attention in the statistical literature due to its applicability in multiple hypotheses testing problems. The model we consider allows for infinite dimensional parameters and offers flexibility in modeling the dependence of the response on the covariates. We discuss the identifiability issues arising in this model and systematically study several estimation strategies. We propose a tuning parameter-free nonparametric maximum likelihood method, implementable via the expectation-maximization algorithm, to estimate the unknown parameters. Further, we derive the rate of convergence of the proposed estimators—in particular we show that the finite sample Hellinger risk for every ‘approximate’ nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator achieves a near-parametric rate (up to logarithmic multiplicative factors). In addition, we propose and theoretically study two ‘marginal’ methods that are more scalable and easily implementable. We demonstrate the efficacy of our procedures through extensive simulation studies and relevant data analyses—one arising from neuroscience and the other from astronomy. We also outline the application of our methods to multiple testing. The companion R package NPMLEmix implements all the procedures proposed in this article.},

As such it cannot be used to draw biologically meaningful conclusions and is therefore unsuitable for the research questions gene-set analysis is generally used to address.Competitive gene-set analysis can be biologically informative but is vulnerable to various forms of confounding and biases as a result of linkage disequilibrium. Of evaluated competitive gene-set analysis methods, only INRICH and MAGMA show consistently good statistical performance.Statistical power for competitive gene-set analysis is strongly dependent on the heritability of a phenotype. Gene-set effect sizes for more strongly heritable phenotypes must be higher to achieve the same level of power as less strongly heritable phenotypes.As a result of the structure of competitive gene-set analysis, increasing sample size will only improve its statistical power to a limited extent, especially for more strongly heritable phenotypes.Gene-set analysis applied to GWAS data and gene expression data show the same kind of statistical behaviour. Both are instances of a broader framework of gene-level analysis, which also includes other approaches such as gene-network analysis.},

These conditions reduce the mapping resolution of marginal association tests–the method most often used in GWAS. Multi-locus Bayesian Variable Selection (BVS) offers a one-stop solution for powerful and precise mapping of risk variants and polygenic risk score (PRS) prediction. We show (with an extensive simulation) that multi-locus BVS methods can achieve high power with a low false discovery rate and a much better mapping resolution than marginal association tests. We demonstrate the performance of BVS for mapping and PRS prediction using data from blood biomarkers from the UK-Biobank (\textasciitilde 300,000 samples and \textasciitilde 5.5 million SNPs). The article is accompanied by open-source R-software that implement the methods used in the study and scales to biobank-sized data.},

We used genomic structural equation modeling and prior genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of educational attainment (n\,=\,1,131,881) and cognitive test performance (n\,=\,257,841) to estimate SNP associations with educational attainment variation that is independent of cognitive ability. We identified 157 genome-wide-significant loci and a polygenic architecture accounting for 57\% of genetic variance in educational attainment. Noncognitive genetics were enriched in the same brain tissues and cell types as cognitive performance, but showed different associations with gray-matter brain volumes. Noncognitive genetics were further distinguished by associations with personality traits, less risky behavior and increased risk for certain psychiatric disorders. For socioeconomic success and longevity, noncognitive and cognitive-performance genetics demonstrated associations of similar magnitude. By conducting a GWAS of a phenotype that was not directly measured, we offer a view of genetic architecture of noncognitive skills influencing educational success.},

  abstract = {Pathway or gene set over-representation analysis (ORA) has become a routine task in functional genomics studies. However, currently widely used ORA tools employ statistical methods such as Fisher’s exact test that reduce a pathway into a list of genes, ignoring the constitutive functional non-equivalent roles of genes and the complex gene-gene interactions. Here, we develop a novel method named LEGO (functional Link Enrichment of Gene Ontology or gene sets) that takes into consideration these two types of information by incorporating network-based gene weights in ORA analysis. In three benchmarks, LEGO achieves better performance than Fisher and three other network-based methods. To further evaluate LEGO’s usefulness, we compare LEGO with five gene expression-based and three pathway topology-based methods using a benchmark of 34 disease gene expression datasets compiled by a recent publication and show that LEGO is among the top-ranked methods in terms of both sensitivity and prioritization for detecting target KEGG pathways. In addition, we develop a cluster-and-filter approach to reduce the redundancy among the enriched gene sets, making the results more interpretable to biologists. Finally, we apply LEGO to two lists of autism genes and identify relevant gene sets to autism that could not be found by Fisher.},

  abstract = {With ideal spatial adaptation, an oracle furnishes information about how best to adapt a spatially variable estimator, whether piecewise constant, piecewise polynomial, variable knot spline, or variable bandwidth kernel, to the unknown function. Estimation with the aid of an oracle offers dramatic advantages over traditional linear estimation by nonadaptive kernels; however, it is a priori unclear whether such performance can be obtained by a procedure relying on the data alone. We describe a new principle for spatially-adaptive estimation: selective wavelet reconstruction. We show that variable-knot spline fits and piecewise-polynomial fits, when equipped with an oracle to select the knots, are not dramatically more powerful than selective wavelet reconstruction with an oracle. We develop a practical spatially adaptive method, RiskShrink, which works by shrinkage of empirical wavelet coefficients. RiskShrink mimics the performance of an oracle for selective wavelet reconstruction as well as it is possible to do so. A new inequality in multivariate normal decision theory which we call the oracle inequality shows that attained performance differs from ideal performance by at most a factor of approximately 2 log n, where n is the sample size. Moreover no estimator can give a better guarantee than this. Within the class of spatially adaptive procedures, RiskShrink is essentially optimal. Relying only on the data, it comes within a factor log2 n of the performance of piecewise polynomial and variableknot spline methods equipped with an oracle. In contrast, it is unknown how or if piecewise polynomial methods could be made to function this well when denied access to an oracle and forced to rely on data alone.},

  abstract = {Higher criticism, or second-level significance testing, is a multiple-comparisons concept mentioned in passing by Tukey. It concerns a situation where there are many independent tests of significance and one is interested in rejecting the joint null hypothesis. Tukey suggested comparing the fraction of observed significances at a given α-level to the expected fraction under the joint null. In fact, he suggested standardizing the difference of the two quantities and forming a z-score; the resulting z-score tests the significance of the body of significance tests. We consider a generalization, where we maximize this z-score over a range of significance levels 0{$<$}α≤α0. We are able to show that the resulting higher criticism statistic is effective at resolving a very subtle testing problem: testing whether n normal means are all zero versus the alternative that a small fraction is nonzero. The subtlety of this “sparse normal means” testing problem can be seen from work of Ingster and Jin, who studied such problems in great detail. In their studies, they identified an interesting range of cases where the small fraction of nonzero means is so small that the alternative hypothesis exhibits little noticeable effect on the distribution of the p-values either for the bulk of the tests or for the few most highly significant tests. In this range, when the amplitude of nonzero means is calibrated with the fraction of nonzero means, the likelihood ratio test for a precisely specified alternative would still succeed in separating the two hypotheses. We show that the higher criticism is successful throughout the same region of amplitude sparsity where the likelihood ratio test would succeed. Since it does not require a specification of the alternative, this shows that higher criticism is in a sense optimally adaptive to unknown sparsity and size of the nonnull effects. While our theoretical work is largely asymptotic, we provide simulations in finite samples and suggest some possible applications. We also show that higher critcism works well over a range of non-Gaussian cases.},

  abstract = {Polygenic scores have recently been used to summarise genetic effects among an ensemble of markers that do not individually achieve significance in a large-scale association study. Markers are selected using an initial training sample and used to construct a score in an independent replication sample by forming the weighted sum of associated alleles within each subject. Association between a trait and this composite score implies that a genetic signal is present among the selected markers, and the score can then be used for prediction of individual trait values. This approach has been used to obtain evidence of a genetic effect when no single markers are significant, to establish a common genetic basis for related disorders, and to construct risk prediction models. In some cases, however, the desired association or prediction has not been achieved. Here, the power and predictive accuracy of a polygenic score are derived from a quantitative genetics model as a function of the sizes of the two samples, explained genetic variance, selection thresholds for including a marker in the score, and methods for weighting effect sizes in the score. Expressions are derived for quantitative and discrete traits, the latter allowing for case/control sampling. A novel approach to estimating the variance explained by a marker panel is also proposed. It is shown that published studies with significant association of polygenic scores have been well powered, whereas those with negative results can be explained by low sample size. It is also shown that useful levels of prediction may only be approached when predictors are estimated from very large samples, up to an order of magnitude greater than currently available. Therefore, polygenic scores currently have more utility for association testing than predicting complex traits, but prediction will become more feasible as sample sizes continue to grow.},

In eQTL studies, one important task is to find eGenes or genes whose expressions are associated with at least one eQTL. The standard statistical method to determine whether a gene is an eGene requires association testing at all nearby variants and the permutation test to correct for multiple testing. The standard method however does not consider genomic annotation of the variants. In practice, variants near gene transcription start sites (TSSs) or certain histone modifications are likely to regulate gene expression. In this article, we introduce a novel eGene detection method that considers this empirical evidence and thereby increases the statistical power.},

  abstract = {Variational Bayes (VB) is a common strategy for approximate Bayesian inference, but simple methods are only available for specific classes of models including, in particular, representations having conditionally conjugate constructions within an exponential family. Models with logit components are an apparently notable exception to this class, due to the absence of conjugacy among the logistic likelihood and the Gaussian priors for the coefficients in the linear predictor. To facilitate approximate inference within this widely used class of models, Jaakkola and Jordan (Stat. Comput. 10 (2000) 25–37) proposed a simple variational approach which relies on a family of tangent quadratic lower bounds of the logistic log-likelihood, thus restoring conjugacy between these approximate bounds and the Gaussian priors. This strategy is still implemented successfully, but few attempts have been made to formally understand the reasons underlying its excellent performance. Following a review on VB for logistic models, we cover this gap by providing a formal connection between the above bound and a recent Pólya-gamma data augmentation for logistic regression. Such a result places the computational methods associated with the aforementioned bounds within the framework of variational inference for conditionally conjugate exponential family models, thereby allowing recent advances for this class to be inherited also by the methods relying on Jaakkola and Jordan (Stat. Comput. 10 (2000) 25–37).},

Although multiple methods exist to perform such a gene-set analysis, most have low statistical power when only a small fraction of the genes are associated with the phenotype. Further, since existing methods cannot identify possible genes driving association signals, interpreting results of such association in terms of the underlying genetic mechanism is challenging. Here, we introduce Gene-set analysis Association Using Sparse Signals (GAUSS), a method for gene-set association analysis with GWAS summary statistics. In addition to providing a p-value for association, GAUSS identifies the subset of genes that have the maximal evidence of association and appears to drive the association. Using pre-computed correlation structure among test statistics from a reference panel, the p-value calculation is substantially faster compared to other permutation or simulation-based approaches. Our numerical experiments show that GAUSS can increase power over several existing methods while controlling type-I error under a variety of association models. Through the analysis of summary statistics from the UK Biobank data for 1,403 phenotypes, we show that GAUSS is scalable and can identify associations across many phenotypes and gene-sets.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Currently, there are two gene-set testing approaches, self-contained and competitive, both of which have their advantages and disadvantages, but neither offers the final solution. We introduce simultaneous enrichment analysis (SEA), a new approach for analysis of feature sets in genomics and other omics based on a new unified null hypothesis, which includes the self-contained and competitive null hypotheses as special cases. We employ closed testing using Simes tests to test this new hypothesis. For every feature set, the proportion of active features is estimated, and a confidence bound is provided.

Theoretical advances have been matched, and more than matched, in the world of applications, where logistic regression by itself has become the go-to methodology in medical statistics, computer-based prediction algorithms, and the social sciences. This book is based on a one-semester graduate course for first year Ph.D. and advanced master's students. After presenting the basic structure of univariate and multivariate exponential families, their application to generalized linear models including logistic and Poisson regression is described in detail, emphasizing geometrical ideas, computational practice, and the analogy with ordinary linear regression. Connections are made with a variety of current statistical methodologies: missing data, survival analysis and proportional hazards, false discovery rates, bootstrapping, and empirical Bayes analysis. The book connects exponential family theory with its applications in a way that doesn't require advanced mathematical preparation.},

Taking an empirical Bayes approach, Bradley Efron, inventor of the bootstrap, shows how information accrues across problems in a way that combines Bayesian and frequentist ideas. Estimation, testing and prediction blend in this framework, producing opportunities for new methodologies of increased power. New difficulties also arise, easily leading to flawed inferences. This book takes a careful look at both the promise and pitfalls of large-scale statistical inference, with particular attention to false discovery rates, the most successful of the new statistical techniques. Emphasis is on the inferential ideas underlying technical developments, illustrated using a large number of real examples.},

Microarrays epitomize this type of technology but similar problems arise in proteomics, time of flight spectroscopy, flow cytometry, FMRI imaging, and massive social science surveys. This paper uses local false discovery rate methods to carry out size and power calculations on large-scale data sets. An empirical Bayes approach allows the fdr analysis to proceed from a minimum of frequentist or Bayesian modeling assumptions. Microarray and simulated data sets are used to illustrate a convenient estimation methodology whose accuracy can be calculated in closed form. A crucial part of the methodology is an fdr assessment of “thinned counts”, what the histogram of test statistics would look like for just the non-null cases.},

We compared the results with those of a SomaScan v4 study on plasma from 36,000 Icelandic people2, for 1,514 of whom Olink data were also available. We found modest correlation between the two platforms. Although cis protein quantitative trait loci were detected for a similar absolute number of assays on the two platforms (2,101 on Olink versus 2,120 on SomaScan), the proportion of assays with such supporting evidence for assay performance was higher on the Olink platform (72\% versus 43\%). A considerable number of proteins had genomic associations that differed between the platforms. We provide examples where differences between platforms may influence conclusions drawn from the integration of protein levels with the study of diseases. We demonstrate how leveraging the diverse ancestries of participants in the UK Biobank helps to detect novel associations and refine genomic location.

During a dynamic process such as cellular differentiation, the overall cell type composition of a tissue (or an in vitro culture) and the gene regulatory profile of each cell can both experience significant changes over time. To identify these dynamic effects in high resolution, we collected single-cell RNA-sequencing data over a differentiation time course from induced pluripotent stem cells to cardiomyocytes, sampled at 7 unique time points in 19 human cell lines. We employed a flexible approach to map dynamic eQTLs whose effects vary significantly over the course of bifurcating differentiation trajectories, including many whose effects are specific to one of these two lineages. Our study design allowed us to distinguish true dynamic eQTLs affecting a specific cell lineage from expression changes driven by potentially non-genetic differences between cell lines such as cell composition. Additionally, we used the cell type profiles learned from single-cell data to deconvolve and re-analyze data from matched bulk RNA-seq samples. Using this approach, we were able to identify a large number of novel dynamic eQTLs in single cell data while also attributing dynamic effects in bulk to a particular lineage. Overall, we found that using single cell data to uncover dynamic eQTLs can provide new insight into the gene regulatory changes that occur among heterogeneous cell types during cardiomyocyte differentiation.},

We introduce a natural Bayesian hierarchical model that treats the latent association status of molecular QTLs as SNP-level annotations for candidate SNPs of complex traits. We detail a computational procedure to seamlessly perform enrichment, fine-mapping and colocalization analyses, which is a distinct feature compared to the existing colocalization analysis procedures in the literature. The proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires only summary-level statistics. We evaluate and demonstrate the proposed computational approach through extensive simulation studies and analyses of blood lipid data and the whole blood eQTL data from the GTEx project. In addition, a useful utility from our proposed method enables the computation of expected colocalization signals using simple characteristics of the association data. Using this utility, we further illustrate the importance of enrichment analysis on the ability to discover colocalized signals and the potential limitations of currently available molecular QTL data.

  abstract = {Chromatin profiling has emerged as a powerful means of genome annotation and detection of regulatory activity. The approach is especially well suited to the characterization of non-coding portions of the genome, which critically contribute to cellular phenotypes yet remain largely uncharted. Here we map nine chromatin marks across nine cell types to systematically characterize regulatory elements, their cell-type specificities and their functional interactions. Focusing on cell-type-specific patterns of promoters and enhancers, we define multicell activity profiles for chromatin state, gene expression, regulatory motif enrichment and regulator expression. We use correlations between these profiles to link enhancers to putative target genes, and predict the cell-type-specific activators and repressors that modulate them. The resulting annotations and regulatory predictions have implications for the interpretation of genome-wide association studies. Top-scoring disease single nucleotide polymorphisms are frequently positioned within enhancer elements specifically active in relevant cell types, and in some cases affect a motif instance for a predicted regulator, thus suggesting a mechanism for the association. Our study presents a general framework for deciphering cis-regulatory connections and their roles in disease.},

  abstract = {Many applications of machine-learning methods involve an iterative protocol in which data are collected, a model is trained, and then outputs of that model are used to choose what data to consider next. For example, a data-driven approach for designing proteins is to train a regression model to predict the fitness of protein sequences and then use it to propose new sequences believed to exhibit greater fitness than observed in the training data. Since validating designed sequences in the wet laboratory is typically costly, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in the model’s predictions. This is challenging because of a characteristic type of distribution shift between the training and test data that arises in the design setting—one in which the training and test data are statistically dependent, as the latter is chosen based on the former. Consequently, the model’s error on the test data—that is, the designed sequences—has an unknown and possibly complex relationship with its error on the training data. We introduce a method to construct confidence sets for predictions in such settings, which account for the dependence between the training and test data. The confidence sets we construct have finite-sample guarantees that hold for any regression model, even when it is used to choose the test-time input distribution. As a motivating use case, we use real datasets to demonstrate how our method quantifies uncertainty for the predicted fitness of designed proteins and can therefore be used to select design algorithms that achieve acceptable tradeoffs between high predicted fitness and low predictive uncertainty.},

However, choosing the relevant annotations for interpreting an association study of a given trait remains challenging. I describe a statistical model that uses association statistics computed across the genome to identify classes of genomic elements that are enriched with or depleted of loci influencing a trait. The model naturally incorporates multiple types of annotations. I applied the model to GWASs of 18 human traits, including red blood cell traits, platelet traits, glucose levels, lipid levels, height, body mass index, and Crohn disease. For each trait, I used the model to evaluate the relevance of 450 different genomic annotations, including protein-coding genes, enhancers, and DNase-I hypersensitive sites in over 100 tissues and cell lines. The fraction of phenotype-associated SNPs influencing protein sequence ranged from around 2\% (for platelet volume) up to around 20\% (for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol), repressed chromatin was significantly depleted for SNPs associated with several traits, and cell-type-specific DNase-I hypersensitive sites were enriched with SNPs associated with several traits (for example, the spleen in platelet volume). Finally, reweighting each GWAS by using information from functional genomics increased the number of loci with high-confidence associations by around 5\%.},

Cellular responses involved different genes and pathways for gene expression and splicing and were highly variable across contexts. For thousands of genes, we identified variable allelic expression across contexts and characterized different types of gene-environment interactions, many of which are associated with complex traits. Promoter functional and evolutionary features distinguished genes with elevated allelic imbalance mean and variance. On average, half of the genes with dynamic regulatory interactions were missed by large eQTL mapping studies, indicating the importance of exploring multiple treatments to reveal previously unrecognized regulatory loci that may be important for disease.},

Here, we introduce a method that leverages polygenic functional enrichment to incorporate coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related genomic annotations into association analyses. We show via simulations with real genotypes that the method, functionally informed novel discovery of risk loci (FINDOR), correctly controls the false-positive rate at null loci and attains a 9\%–38\% increase in the number of independent associations detected at causal loci, depending on trait polygenicity and sample size. We applied FINDOR to 27 independent complex traits and diseases from the interim UK Biobank release (average N = 130K). Averaged across traits, we attained a 13\% increase in genome-wide significant loci detected (including a 20\% increase for disease traits) compared to unweighted raw p values that do not use functional data. We replicated the additional loci in independent UK Biobank and non-UK Biobank data, yielding a highly statistically significant replication slope (0.66–0.69) in each case. Finally, we applied FINDOR to the full UK Biobank release (average N~= 416K), attaining smaller relative improvements (consistent with simulations) but larger absolute improvements, detecting an additional 583 GWAS loci. In conclusion, leveraging functional enrichment using our method robustly increases GWAS power.},

We applied our approach to gene expression data from several sources together with GWAS summary statistics for 48 diseases and traits (average N\,=\,169,331) and found significant tissue-specific enrichments (false discovery rate (FDR)\,{$<$}\,5\%) for 34 traits. In our analysis of multiple tissues, we detected a broad range of enrichments that recapitulated known biology. In our brain-specific analysis, significant enrichments included an enrichment of inhibitory over excitatory neurons for bipolar disorder, and excitatory over inhibitory neurons for schizophrenia and body mass index.

In exponential families with canonical parameterization the effect is to penalize the likelihood by the Jeffreys invariant prior. In binomial logistic models, Poisson log linear models and certain other generalized linear models, the Jeffreys prior penalty function can be imposed in standard regression software using a scheme of iterative adjustments to the data.},

  abstract = {A major challenge in understanding gene regulation is the unequivocal identification of enhancer elements and uncovering their connections to genes. We present GeneHancer, a novel database of human enhancers and their inferred target genes, in the framework of GeneCards. First, we integrated a total of 434 000 reported enhancers from four different genome-wide databases: the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE), the Ensembl regulatory build, the functional annotation of the mammalian genome (FANTOM) project and the VISTA Enhancer Browser. Employing an integration algorithm that aims to remove redundancy, GeneHancer portrays 285 000 integrated candidate enhancers (covering 12.4\% of the genome), 94 000 of which are derived from more than one source, and each assigned an annotation-derived confidence score. GeneHancer subsequently links enhancers to genes, using: tissue co-expression correlation between genes and enhancer RNAs, as well as enhancer-targeted transcription factor genes; expression quantitative trait loci for variants within enhancers; and capture Hi-C, a promoter-specific genome conformation assay. The individual scores based on each of these four methods, along with gene–enhancer genomic distances, form the basis for GeneHancer’s combinatorial likelihood-based scores for enhancer–gene pairing. Finally, we define ‘elite’ enhancer–gene relations reflecting both a high-likelihood enhancer definition and a strong enhancer–gene association.GeneHancer predictions are fully integrated in the widely used GeneCards Suite, whereby candidate enhancers and their annotations are displayed on every relevant GeneCard. This assists in the mapping of non-coding variants to enhancers, and via the linked genes, forms a basis for variant–phenotype interpretation of whole-genome sequences in health and disease.Database URL:http://www.genecards.org/},

Our approach separately calibrates a data-dependent p-value rejection threshold for each hypothesis, relaxing or tightening the threshold as appropriate to target exact FDR control. In addition to our general framework we propose a concrete algorithm, the dependence-adjusted Benjamini-Hochberg (dBH) procedure, which adaptively thresholds the q-value for each hypothesis. Under positive regression dependence the dBH procedure uniformly dominates the standard BH procedure, and in general it uniformly dominates the Benjamini-Yekutieli (BY) procedure (also known as BH with log correction). Simulations and real data examples illustrate power gains over competing approaches to FDR control under dependence.},

The presence of background RNA can lead to systematic biases and batch effects in various downstream analyses such as differential expression and marker gene discovery. In this paper, we explore the phenomenology and mechanisms of background RNA generation in dropletbased scRNA-seq assays and present a deep generative model of background-contaminated counts mirroring those mechanisms. The model is used for learning the background RNA profile, distinguishing cell-containing droplets from empty ones, and retrieving background-free gene expression profiles. We implement the model along with a fast and scalable inference algorithm as the remove-background module in CellBender, an open-source scRNA-seq data processing software package. Finally, we present simulations and investigations of several scRNA-seq datasets to show that processing raw data using CellBender significantly boosts the magnitude and specificity of differential expression across different cell types.},

  abstract = {Functional analysis of large sets of genes and proteins is becoming more and more necessary with the increase of experimental biomolecular data at omic-scale. Enrichment analysis is by far the most popular available methodology to derive functional implications of sets of cooperating genes. The problem with these techniques relies in the redundancy of resulting information, that in most cases generate lots of trivial results with high risk to mask the reality of key biological events. We present and describe a computational method, called GeneTerm Linker, that filters and links enriched output data identifying sets of associated genes and terms, producing metagroups of coherent biological significance. The method uses fuzzy reciprocal linkage between genes and terms to unravel their functional convergence and associations. The algorithm is tested with a small set of well known interacting proteins from yeast and with a large collection of reference sets from three heterogeneous resources: multiprotein complexes (CORUM), cellular pathways (SGD) and human diseases (OMIM). Statistical Precision, Recall and balanced F-score are calculated showing robust results, even when different levels of random noise are included in the test sets. Although we could not find an equivalent method, we present a comparative analysis with a widely used method that combines enrichment and functional annotation clustering. A web application to use the method here proposed is provided at http://gtlinker.cnb.csic.es.},

  abstract = {Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal. Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs) and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We find that few genes are truly ‘housekeeping’, whereas many mammalian promoters are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.},

  abstract = {Classical genes within the Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) are responsible for peptide presentation to T cells, thus playing a central role in immune defense against pathogens. These genes are subject to strong selective pressures including both balancing and directional selection, resulting in exceptional genetic diversity—thousands of alleles per gene. Moreover, some alleles appear to be shared between primate species, a phenomenon known as trans-species polymorphism (TSP) or incomplete lineage sorting, which is rare in the genome overall. However, despite the clinical and evolutionary importance of MHC diversity, we currently lack a full picture of primate MHC evolution. To start addressing this gap, we used Bayesian phylogenetic methods to determine the extent of TSP at six classical MHC genes. We find strong support for TSP in all six genes, including between humans and old-world monkeys in HLA-DRB1 and even—remarkably—between humans and new-world monkeys in HLA-DQB1. Despite the long-term persistence of ancient lineages, we additionally observe rapid evolution at amino acids within the peptide-binding domain. The most rapidly-evolving positions are also strongly enriched for autoimmune and infectious disease associations. Together, these results suggest complex selective forces arising from di↵erential peptide binding, which drive short-term allelic turnover within lineages while also maintaining deeply divergent lineages for at least 45 million years.},

All control mFDR, which is the ratio of the expected number of false rejections to the expected number of rejections. mFDR is a weaker criterion than the false discovery rate, which is the expected value of the ratio. We compensate for this weakness by showing that α-investing controls mFDR at every rejected hypothesis. α-investing resembles α-spending that is used in sequential trials, but it has a key difference. When a test rejects a null hypothesis, α-investing earns additional probability towards subsequent tests. α-investing hence allows us to incorporate domain knowledge into the testing procedure and to improve the power of the tests. In this way, α-investing enables the statistician to design a testing procedure for a specific problem while guaranteeing control of mFDR.},

  abstract = {Boosting is one of the most important recent developments in classification methodology. Boosting works by sequentially applying a classification algorithm to reweighted versions of the training data and then taking a weighted majority vote of the sequence of classifiers thus produced. For many classification algorithms, this simple strategy results in dramatic improvements in performance. We show that this seemingly mysterious phenomenon can be understood in terms of well-known statistical principles, namely additive modeling and maximum likelihood. For the two-class problem, boosting can be viewed as an approximation to additive modeling on the logistic scale using maximum Bernoulli likelihood as a criterion. We develop more direct approximations and show that they exhibit nearly identical results to boosting. Direct multiclass generalizations based on multinomial likelihood are derived that exhibit performance comparable to other recently proposed multiclass generalizations of boosting in most situations, and far superior in some. We suggest a minor modification to boosting that can reduce computation, often by factors of 10 to 50. Finally, we apply these insights to produce an alternative formulation of boosting decision trees. This approach, based on best-first truncated tree induction, often leads to better performance, and can provide interpretable descriptions of the aggregate decision rule. It is also much faster computationally, making it more suitable to large-scale data mining applications.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the tissue-specific binding sites of transcription factors (TFs) is essential to reconstruct gene regulatory networks and predict functions for non-coding genetic variation. DNase-seq footprinting enables the prediction of genome-wide binding sites for hundreds of TFs simultaneously. Despite the public availability of high-quality DNase-seq data from hundreds of samples, a comprehensive, up-to-date resource for the locations of genomic footprints is lacking. Here, we develop a scalable footprinting workflow using two stateof-the-art algorithms: Wellington and HINT. We apply our workflow to detect footprints in 192 ENCODE DNase-seq experiments and predict the genomic occupancy of 1,515 human TFs in 27 human tissues. We validate that these footprints overlap true-positive TF binding sites from ChIP-seq. We demonstrate that the locations, depth, and tissue specificity of footprints predict effects of genetic variants on gene expression and capture a substantial proportion of genetic risk for complex traits.},

  abstract = {The textbook view that most germline mutations in mammals arise from replication errors is indirectly supported by the fact that there are both more mutations and more cell divisions in the male than in the female germline. When analyzing large de novo mutation datasets in humans, we find multiple lines of evidence that call that view into question. Notably, despite the drastic increase in the ratio of male to female germ cell divisions after the onset of spermatogenesis, even young fathers contribute three times more mutations than young mothers, and this ratio barely increases with parental age. This surprising finding points to a substantial contribution of damage-induced mutations. Indeed, C-to-G transversions and CpG transitions, which together constitute over one-fourth of all base substitution mutations, show genomic distributions and sex-specific age dependencies indicative of double-strand break repair and methylation-associated damage, respectively. Moreover, we find evidence that maternal age at conception influences the mutation rate both because of the accumulation of damage in oocytes and potentially through an influence on the number of postzygotic mutations in the embryo. These findings reveal underappreciated roles of DNA damage and maternal age in the genesis of human germline mutations.},

  abstract = {Testing for a difference in means between two groups is fundamental to answering research questions across virtually every scientific area. Classical tests control the Type I error rate when the groups are defined a priori. However, when the groups are instead defined via a clustering algorithm, then applying a classical test for a difference in means between the groups yields an extremely inflated Type I error rate. Notably, this problem persists even if two separate and independent data sets are used to define the groups and to test for a difference in their means. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a selective inference approach to test for a difference in means between two clusters obtained from any clustering method. Our procedure controls the selective Type I error rate by accounting for the fact that the null hypothesis was generated from the data. We describe how to efficiently compute exact p-values for clusters obtained using agglomerative hierarchical clustering with many commonly used linkages. We apply our method to simulated data and to single-cell RNA-seq data.},

We partitioned the heritability of both low-frequency (0.5\%≤\,minor allele frequency {$<$}5\%) and common (minor allele frequency ≥5\%) variants in 40 UK Biobank traits across a broad set of functional annotations. We determined that non-synonymous coding variants explain 17\,±\,1\% of low-frequency variant heritability (\$\$h\_\{\{\textbackslash mathrm\{lf\}\}\}\^2\$\$) versus 2.1\,±\,0.2\% of common variant heritability (\$\$h\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{c\}\}\^2\$\$). Cell-type-specific non-coding annotations that were significantly enriched for \$\$h\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{c\}\}\^2\$\$of corresponding traits were similarly enriched for \$\$h\_\{\{\textbackslash mathrm\{lf\}\}\}\^2\$\$for most traits, but more enriched for brain-related annotations and traits. For example, H3K4me3 marks in brain dorsolateral prefrontal cortex explain 57\,±\,12\% of \$\$h\_\{\{\textbackslash mathrm\{lf\}\}\}\^2\$\$versus 12\,±\,2\% of \$\$h\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{c\}\}\^2\$\$for neuroticism. Forward simulations confirmed that low-frequency variant enrichment depends on the mean selection coefficient of causal variants in the annotation, and can be used to predict effect size variance of causal rare variants (minor allele frequency {$<$}0.5\%).},

We determined that SNPs with low LLD have significantly larger per-SNP heritability, and that roughly half of this effect can be explained by functional annotations negatively correlated with LLD, such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHS). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that more recent common variants tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability (P=2.38×10−104); the youngest 20\% of common SNPs explain 3.9x more heritability than the oldest 20\%, consistent with the action of negative selection.

  abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that can stably repress gene expression. Because of its biological and clinical significance, several methods have been developed to compare genome-wide patterns of methylation between groups of samples. The application of gene set analysis to identify relevant groups of genes that are enriched for differentially methylated genes is often a major component of the analysis of these data. This can be used, for example, to identify processes or pathways that are perturbed in disease development. We show that gene-set analysis, as it is typically applied to genome-wide methylation assays, is severely biased as a result of differences in the numbers of CpG sites associated with different classes of genes and gene promoters.Results: We demonstrate this bias using published data from a study of differential CpG island methylation in lung cancer and a dataset we generated to study methylation changes in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis. We show that several of the gene sets that seem enriched would also be identified with randomized data. We suggest two existing approaches that can be adapted to correct the bias. Accounting for the bias in the lung cancer and ulcerative colitis datasets provides novel biological insights into the role of methylation in cancer development and chronic inflammation, respectively. Our results have significant implications for many previous genome-wide methylation studies that have drawn conclusions on the basis of such strongly biased analysis.Contact:cathal.seoighe@nuigalway.ieSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

This assumption renders these theories inadequate for characterizing 21\$\^\{st\}\$ century real world data problems, which are typically characterized by evaluation distributions that differ from the training data distributions (referred to as out-of-distribution learning). We therefore make a small change to existing formal definitions of learnability by relaxing that assumption. We then introduce \$\textbackslash mathbf\{learning\textbackslash{} efficiency\}\$ (LE) to quantify the amount a learner is able to leverage data for a given problem, regardless of whether it is an in- or out-of-distribution problem. We then define and prove the relationship between generalized notions of learnability, and show how this framework is sufficiently general to characterize transfer, multitask, meta, continual, and lifelong learning. We hope this unification helps bridge the gap between empirical practice and theoretical guidance in real world problems. Finally, because biological learning continues to outperform machine learning algorithms on certain OOD challenges, we discuss the limitations of this framework vis-\textbackslash 'a-vis its ability to formalize biological learning, suggesting multiple avenues for future research.},

In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are commonly restricted to selected datasets and biological reasoning on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. Results: We develop an extensible framework for reproducible benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression datasets investigating 42 human diseases.

  abstract = {Motivation: Although gene set enrichment analysis has become an integral part of high-throughput gene expression data analysis, the assessment of enrichment methods remains rudimentary and ad hoc. In the absence of suitable gold standards, evaluations are commonly restricted to selected datasets and biological reasoning on the relevance of resulting enriched gene sets. Results: We develop an extensible framework for reproducible benchmarking of enrichment methods based on defined criteria for applicability, gene set prioritization and detection of relevant processes. This framework incorporates a curated compendium of 75 expression datasets investigating 42 human diseases. The compendium features microarray and RNA-seq measurements, and each dataset is associated with a precompiled GO/KEGG relevance ranking for the corresponding disease under investigation. We perform a comprehensive assessment of 10 major enrichment methods, identifying significant differences in runtime and applicability to RNA-seq data, fraction of enriched gene sets depending on the null hypothesis tested and recovery of the predefined relevance rankings.

  abstract = {In a predictive model, what is the expected difference in the outcome associated with a unit difference in one of the inputs? In a linear regression model without interactions, this average predictive comparison is simply a regression coefficient (with associated uncertainty). In a model with nonlinearity or interactions, however, the average predictive comparison in general depends on the values of the predictors. We consider various definitions based on averages over a population distribution of the predictors, and we compute standard errors based on uncertainty in model parameters. We illustrate with a study of criminal justice data for urban counties in the United States. The outcome of interest measures whether a convicted felon received a prison sentence rather than a jail or non-custodial sentence, with predictors available at both individual and county levels. We fit three models: (1) a hierarchical logistic regression with varying coefficients for the within-county intercepts as well as for each individual predictor; (2) a hierarchical model with varying intercepts only; and (3) a nonhierarchical model that ignores the multilevel nature of the data. The regression coefficients have different interpretations for the different models; in contrast, the models can be compared directly using predictive comparisons. Furthermore, predictive comparisons clarify the interplay between the individual and county predictors for the hierarchical models and also illustrate the relative size of varying county effects.},

Here are a few holes in Bayesian data analysis: (1) the usual rules of conditional probability fail in the quantum realm, (2) flat or weak priors lead to terrible inferences about things we care about, (3) subjective priors are incoherent, (4) Bayesian decision picks the wrong model, (5) Bayes factors fail in the presence of flat or weak priors, (6) for Cantorian reasons we need to check our models, but this destroys the coherence of Bayesian inference. Some of the problems of Bayesian statistics arise from people trying to do things they should not be trying to do, but other holes are not so easily patched. In particular, it may be a good idea to avoid flat, weak, or conventional priors, but such advice, if followed, would go against the vast majority of Bayesian practice and requires us to confront the fundamental incoherence of Bayesian inference. This does not mean that we think Bayesian inference is a bad idea, but it does mean that there is a tension between Bayesian logic and Bayesian workflow which we believe can only be resolved by considering Bayesian logic as a tool, a way of revealing inevitable misfits and incoherences in our model assumptions, rather than as an end in itself.},

However, power analysis is flawed in that a narrow emphasis on statistical significance is placed as the primary focus of study design.

To help researchers address this problem in the context of their own studies, we recommend design calculations in which (a) the probability of an estimate being in the wrong direction (Type S [sign] error) and (b) the factor by which the magnitude of an effect might be overestimated (Type M [magnitude] error or exaggeration ratio) are estimated. We illustrate with examples from recent published research and discuss the largest challenge in a design calculation: coming up with reasonable estimates of plausible effect sizes based on external information.},

From different perspectives, such nonuniform distributions have been portrayed as desirable (as reflecting an ability of vague prior distributions to nonetheless yield accurate posterior predictions) or undesirable (as making it more difficult to reject a false model). We explore this tension through two simple normal-distribution examples. In one example, we argue that the low power of the posterior predictive check is desirable from a statistical perspective; in the other, the posterior predictive check seems inappropriate. Our conclusion is that the relevance of the p-value depends on the applied context, a point which (ironically) can be seen even in these two toy examples.},

We challenge the Type I error paradigm that underlies these corrections. Moreover we posit that the problem of multiple comparisons can disappear entirely when viewed from a hierarchical Bayesian perspective. We propose building multilevel models in the settings where multiple comparisons arise. Multilevel models perform partial pooling (shifting estimates toward each other), whereas classical procedures typically keep the centers of intervals stationary, adjusting for multiple comparisons by making the intervals wider (or, equivalently, adjusting the p values corresponding to intervals of fixed width). Thus, multilevel models address the multiple comparisons problem and also yield more efficient estimates, especially in settings with low group-level variation, which is where multiple comparisons are a particular concern.},

  abstract = {Variational methods are widely used for approximate posterior inference. However, their use is typically limited to families of distributions that enjoy particular conjugacy properties. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a family of variational approximations inspired by nonparametric kernel density estimation. The locations of these kernels and their bandwidth are treated as variational parameters and optimized to improve an approximate lower bound on the marginal likelihood of the data. Using multiple kernels allows the approximation to capture multiple modes of the posterior, unlike most other variational approximations. We demonstrate the efficacy of the nonparametric approximation with a hierarchical logistic regression model and a nonlinear matrix factorization model. We obtain predictive performance as good as or better than more specialized variational methods and sample-based approximations. The method is easy to apply to more general graphical models for which standard variational methods are difficult to derive.},

  abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {$>$}100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/).

This observation was surprising, as it contradicted much of the comparative gene regulatory data collected previously, as well as the common notion that major developmental pathways are highly conserved across a wide range of species, in particular across mammals. Here we show that the Mouse ENCODE gene expression data were collected using a flawed study design, which confounded sequencing batch (namely, the assignment of samples to sequencing flowcells and lanes) with species. When we account for the batch effect, the corrected comparative gene expression data from human and mouse tend to cluster by tissue, not by species.},

  abstract = {The Model-X knockoff procedure has recently emerged as a powerful approach for feature selection with statistical guarantees. The advantage of knockoffs is that if we have a good model of the features X, then we can identify salient features without knowing anything about how the outcome Y depends on X. An important drawback of knockoffs is its instability: running the procedure twice can result in very different selected features, potentially leading to different conclusions. Addressing this instability is critical for obtaining reproducible and robust results. Here we present a generalization of the knockoff procedure that we call simultaneous multi-knockoffs. We show that multi-knockoffs guarantee false discovery rate (FDR) control, and are substantially more stable and powerful compared to the standard (single) knockoffs.  Moreover we propose a new algorithm based on entropy maximization for generating Gaussian multi-knockoffs. We validate the improved stability and power of multi-knockoffs in systematic experiments. We also illustrate how multi-knockoffs can improve the accuracy of detecting genetic mutations that are causally linked to phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Mean-field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is an approximate Bayesian posterior inference technique that is increasingly popular due to its fast runtimes on large-scale data sets. However, even when MFVB provides accurate posterior means for certain parameters, it often mis-estimates variances and covariances. Furthermore, prior robustness measures have remained undeveloped for MFVB. By deriving a simple formula for the effect of infinitesimal model perturbations on MFVB posterior means, we provide both improved covariance estimates and local robustness measures for MFVB, thus greatly expanding the practical usefulness of MFVB posterior approximations. The estimates for MFVB posterior covariances rely on a result from the classical Bayesian robustness literature that relates derivatives of posterior expectations to posterior covariances and includes the Laplace approximation as a special case. Our key condition is that the MFVB approximation provides good estimates of a select subset of posterior means—an assumption that has been shown to hold in many practical settings. In our experiments, we demonstrate that our methods are simple, general, and fast, providing accurate posterior uncertainty estimates and robustness measures with runtimes that can be an order of magnitude faster than MCMC.},

However, it is well known that a major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model variable covariance. We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables---both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data.},

We interrogate the in vitro enhancer activity and in vivo epigenetic landscape of more than 3,100 HARs during human neurodevelopment, demonstrating that many HARs appear to act as neurodevelopmental enhancers and that sequence divergence at HARs has largely augmented their neuronal enhancer activity. Furthermore, we demonstrate PPP1R17 to be a putative HAR-regulated gene that has undergone remarkable rewiring of its cell type and developmental expression patterns between non-primates and primates and between non-human primates and humans. Finally, we show that PPP1R17 slows neural progenitor cell cycle progression, paralleling the cell cycle length increase seen predominantly in primate and especially human neurodevelopment. Our findings establish HARs as key components in rewiring human-specific neurodevelopmental gene regulatory programs and provide an integrated resource to study enhancer activity of specific HARs.},

Here, we report the major developments of the GO resource during the past two years. Each monthly release of the GO resource is now packaged and given a unique identifier (DOI), enabling GO-based analyses on a specific release to be reproduced in the future. The molecular function ontology has been refactored to better represent the overall activities of gene products, with a focus on transcription regulator activities. Quality assurance efforts have been ramped up to address potentially out-of-date or inaccurate annotations. New evidence codes for high-throughput experiments now enable users to filter out annotations obtained from these sources. GO-CAM, a new framework for representing gene function that is more expressive than standard GO annotations, has been released, and users can now explore the growing repository of these models. We also provide the ‘GO ribbon’ widget for visualizing GO annotations to a gene; the widget can be easily embedded in any web page.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes, whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate a preferential methodology of gene set testing. RESULTS: We identify some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods. P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes, the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative, as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

Existing models for this class of data rely on the Dirichlet distribution or other related loss functions; here we show these standard choices suffer systematically from a number of limitations, including bias and numerical issues that frustrate the use of flexible network models upstream of these distributions. We resolve these limitations by introducing a novel exponential family of distributions for modeling simplex-valued data - the continuous categorical, which arises as a nontrivial multivariate generalization of the recently discovered continuous Bernoulli. Unlike the Dirichlet and other typical choices, the continuous categorical results in a well-behaved probabilistic loss function that produces unbiased estimators, while preserving the mathematical simplicity of the Dirichlet. As well as exploring its theoretical properties, we introduce sampling methods for this distribution that are amenable to the reparameterization trick, and evaluate their performance. Lastly, we demonstrate that the continuous categorical outperforms standard choices empirically, across a simulation study, an applied example on multi-party elections, and a neural network compression task.},

  abstract = {The question of how cell-to-cell differences in transcription rate affect RNA count distributions is fundamental for understanding biological processes underlying transcription. Answering this question requires quantitative models that are both interpretable (describing concrete biophysical phenomena) and tractable (amenable to mathematical analysis). This enables the identification of experiments which best discriminate between competing hypotheses. As a proof of principle, we introduce a simple but flexible class of models involving a continuous stochastic transcription rate driving a discrete RNA transcription and splicing process, and compare and contrast two biologically plausible hypotheses about transcription rate variation. One assumes variation is due to DNA experiencing mechanical strain, while the other assumes it is due to regulator number fluctuations. We introduce a framework for numerically and analytically studying such models, and apply Bayesian model selection to identify candidate genes that show signatures of each model in single-cell transcriptomic data from mouse glutamatergic neurons.},

We give an elementary motivation and explanation of approximation techniques, starting with Taylor series expansions and progressing to the Laplace approximation of integrals. These approximations are illustrated with examples of the convolution of simple densities. We then turn to the saddlepoint approximation and, using both the Fourier inversion formula and Edgeworth expansions, we derive the saddlepoint approximation to the density of a single random variable. We next approximate the density of the sample mean of iid random variables, and also demonstrate the technique for approximating the density of a maximum likelihood estimator in exponential families.},

  abstract = {Causal graph discovery and causal effect estimation are two fundamental tasks in causal inference. While many methods have been developed for each task individually, statistical challenges arise when applying these methods jointly: estimating causal effects after running causal discovery algorithms on the same data leads to "double dipping," invalidating coverage guarantees of classical confidence intervals. To this end, we develop tools for valid post-causal-discovery inference. One key contribution is a randomized version of the greedy equivalence search (GES) algorithm, which permits a valid, finite-sample correction of classical confidence intervals. Across empirical studies, we show that a naive combination of causal discovery and subsequent inference algorithms typically leads to highly inflated miscoverage rates; at the same time, our noisy GES method provides reliable coverage control while achieving more accurate causal graph recovery than data splitting.},

The standard statistical approach to measuring overrepresentation of GO terms cannot cope with the dependencies resulting from the structure of GO because they analyze each term in isolation.

We introduce genomic structural equation modelling (genomic SEM): a multivariate method for analysing the joint genetic architecture of complex traits. Genomic SEM synthesizes genetic correlations and single-nucleotide polymorphism heritabilities inferred from GWAS summary statistics of individual traits from samples with varying and unknown degrees of overlap. Genomic SEM can be used to model multivariate genetic associations among phenotypes, identify variants with effects on general dimensions of cross-trait liability, calculate more predictive polygenic scores and identify loci that cause divergence between traits. We demonstrate several applications of genomic SEM, including a joint analysis of summary statistics from five psychiatric traits. We identify 27 independent single-nucleotide polymorphisms not previously identified in the contributing univariate GWASs. Polygenic scores from genomic SEM consistently outperform those from univariate GWASs. Genomic SEM is flexible and open ended, and allows for continuous innovation in multivariate genetic analysis.},

Knowing the identity of the stem cell is crucial to understanding tissue homeostasis and its aberrations upon disease. Here we present a computational method for the derivation of a lineage tree from single-cell transcriptome data. By exploiting the tree topology and the transcriptome composition, we establish StemID, an algorithm for identifying stem cells among all detectable cell types within a population. We demonstrate that StemID recovers two known adult stem cell populations, Lgr5+ cells in the small intestine and hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow.

We hope that StemID will accelerate the search for novel stem cells by providing concrete markers for biological follow-up and validation.,                                        •               StemID infers the lineage tree and identifies stem cells from single-cell mRNA-seq data                                         •               Direct links of stem cells to distinct sub-types reflect transcriptome plasticity                                         •               The permissive stem cell transcriptome is characterized by high entropy                                         •               StemID infers candidate multipotent cell populations in the human pancreas                                 , Grün et~al. developed an algorithm, StemID, for the derivation of cell lineage trees and identification of stem cells from single-cell mRNA sequencing data.

Using this approach, we identify a set of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation whose expression is coordinately decreased in human diabetic muscle. Expression of these genes is high at sites of insulin-mediated glucose disposal, activated by PGC-1α and correlated with total-body aerobic capacity. Our results associate this gene set with clinically important variation in human metabolism and illustrate the value of pathway relationships in the analysis of genomic profiling experiments.},

  abstract = {Background: Population structure among study subjects may confound genetic association studies, and lack of proper correction can lead to spurious findings. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project largely contains individuals of European ancestry, but the v8 release also includes up to 15\% of individuals of non-European ancestry. Assessing ancestry-based adjustments in GTEx improves portability of this research across populations and further characterizes the impact of population structure on GWAS colocalization. Results: Here, we identify a subset of 117 individuals in GTEx (v8) with a high degree of population admixture and estimate genome-wide local ancestry. We perform genome-wide cis-eQTL mapping using admixed samples in seven tissues, adjusted by either global or local ancestry. Consistent with previous work, we observe improved power with local ancestry adjustment. At loci where the two adjustments produce different lead variants, we observe 31 loci (0.02\%) where a significant colocalization is called only with one eQTL ancestry adjustment method. Notably, both adjustments produce similar numbers of significant colocalizations within each of two different colocalization methods, COLOC and FINEMAP. Finally, we identify a small subset of eQTL-associated variants highly correlated with local ancestry, providing a resource to enhance functional follow-up. Conclusions: We provide a local ancestry map for admixed individuals in the GTEx v8 release and describe the impact of ancestry and admixture on gene expression, eQTLs, and GWAS colocalization. While the majority of the results are concordant between local and global ancestry-based adjustments, we identify distinct advantages and disadvantages to each approach.},

  abstract = {Variational inference (VI) provides fast approximations of a Bayesian posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian). For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.},

  abstract = {We study three notions of uncertainty quantification—calibration, confidence intervals and prediction sets—for binary classification in the distribution-free setting, that is without making any distributional assumptions on the data. With a focus towards calibration, we establish a ‘tripod’ of theorems that connect these three notions for score-based classifiers. A direct implication is that distributionfree calibration is only possible, even asymptotically, using a scoring function whose level sets partition the feature space into at most countably many sets. Parametric calibration schemes such as variants of Platt scaling do not satisfy this requirement, while nonparametric schemes based on binning do. To close the loop, we derive distribution-free confidence intervals for binned probabilities for both fixed-width and uniform-mass binning. As a consequence of our ‘tripod’ theorems, these confidence intervals for binned probabilities lead to distributionfree calibration. We also derive extensions to settings with streaming data and covariate shift.},

Histogram binning has displayed strong practical performance, but theoretical guarantees have only been shown for sample split versions that avoid 'double dipping' the data. We demonstrate that the statistical cost of sample splitting is practically significant on a credit default dataset. We then prove calibration guarantees for the original method that double dips the data, using a certain Markov property of order statistics. Based on our results, we make practical recommendations for choosing the number of bins in histogram binning. In our illustrative simulations, we propose a new tool for assessing calibration -- validity plots -- which provide more information than an ECE estimate.

  abstract = {Regulatory and coding variants are known to be enriched with associations identified by genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of complex disease, but their contributions to trait heritability are currently unknown. We applied variance-component methods to imputed genotype data for 11 common diseases to partition the heritability explained by genotyped SNPs (hg2) across functional categories (while accounting for shared variance due to linkage disequilibrium). Extensive simulations showed that in contrast to current estimates from GWAS summary statistics, the variance-component approach partitions heritability accurately under a wide range of complex-disease architectures. Across the 11 diseases DNaseI hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) from 217 cell types spanned 16\% of imputed SNPs (and 24\% of genotyped SNPs) but explained an average of 79\% (SE = 8\%) of hg2 from imputed SNPs (5.1× enrichment; p = 3.7~× 10−17) and 38\% (SE = 4\%) of hg2 from genotyped SNPs (1.6× enrichment, p = 1.0~× 10−4). Further enrichment was observed at enhancer DHSs and cell-type-specific DHSs. In contrast, coding variants, which span 1\% of the genome, explained {$<$}10\% of hg2 despite having the highest enrichment. We replicated these findings but found no significant contribution from rare coding variants in independent schizophrenia cohorts genotyped on GWAS and exome chips. Our results highlight the value of analyzing components of heritability to unravel the functional architecture of common disease.},

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data exhibits significant cell-to-cell variation due to technical factors, including the number of molecules detected in each cell, which can confound biological heterogeneity with technical effects. To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from “regularized negative binomial regression,” where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

To infer these relationships in the human brain, we implemented Mendelian randomisation using single cell-type expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) as genetic anchors. Expression QTLs were mapped across 8 major cell-types in brain tissue exclusively ascertained from donors with no history of brain disease. We report evidence for a causal association between the change in expression of 118 genes and one or more of 16 brain phenotypes, revealing candidate targets for risk mitigation and opportunities for shared preventative therapeutic strategies. We highlight key causal genes for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disease and for each, we report its cellular context and the therapeutic directionality required for risk mitigation. Our use of control samples establishes a new resource for the causal interpretation of GWAS risk alleles for human brain phenotypes.},

This work surveys and extends recent research which demonstrates that randomization offers a powerful tool for performing low-rank matrix approximation. These techniques exploit modern computational architectures more fully than classical methods and open the possibility of dealing with truly massive data sets. This paper presents a modular framework for constructing randomized algorithms that compute partial matrix decompositions. These methods use random sampling to identify a subspace that captures most of the action of a matrix. The input matrix is then compressed---either explicitly or implicitly---to this subspace, and the reduced matrix is manipulated deterministically to obtain the desired low-rank factorization. In many cases, this approach beats its classical competitors in terms of accuracy, speed, and robustness. These claims are supported by extensive numerical experiments and a detailed error analysis.},

Current pathway-identification methods generally focus on only the changes of gene expression levels; however, the biological relationships among genes are also the fundamental components of pathways and the dysregulated relationships may also alter the pathway activities. We propose a powerful computational method, Edge Set Enrichment Analysis (ESEA), for the identification of dysregulated pathways. This provides a novel way of pathway analysis by investigating the changes of biological relationships of pathways in the context of gene expression data. Simulation studies illustrate the power and performance of ESEA under various simulated conditions. Using real datasets from p53 mutation, Type 2 diabetes and lung cancer, we validate effectiveness of ESEA in identifying dysregulated pathways. We further compare our results with five other pathway enrichment analysis methods. With these analyses, we show that ESEA is able to help uncover dysregulated biological pathways underlying complex traits and human diseases via specific use of the dysregulated biological relationships. We develop a freely available R-based tool of ESEA. Currently, ESEA can support pathway analysis of the seven public databases (KEGG; Reactome; Biocarta; NCI; SPIKE; HumanCyc; Panther).},

  abstract = {Across a wide range of studies, researchers often conclude that the home environment and children’s outcomes are causally linked. In contrast, behavioral genetic studies show that parents influence their children by providing them with both environment and genes, meaning the environment that parents provide should not be considered in the absence of genetic influences, because that can lead to erroneous conclusions on causation. This article seeks to provide behavioral scientists with a synopsis of numerous methods to estimate the direct effect of the environment, controlling for the potential of genetic confounding. Ideally, using genetically sensitive designs can fully disentangle this genetic confound, but these require specialized samples. In the near future, researchers will likely have access to measured DNA variants (summarized in a polygenic scores), which could serve as a partial genetic control, but that is currently not an option that is ideal or widely available. We also propose a work around for when genetically sensitive data are not readily available: the Familial Control Method. In this method, one measures the same trait in the parents as the child, and the parents’ trait is then used as a covariate (e.g., a genetic proxy). When these options are all not possible, we plead with our colleagues to clearly mention genetic confound as a limitation, and to be cautious with any environmental causal statements which could lead to unnecessary parent blaming.},

We introduce the class of generalized additive models which replaces the linear form \$\textbackslash sum \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ by a sum of smooth functions \$\textbackslash sum s\_j(X\_j)\$. The \$s\_j(\textbackslash cdot)\$'s are unspecified functions that are estimated using a scatterplot smoother, in an iterative procedure we call the local scoring algorithm. The technique is applicable to any likelihood-based regression model: the class of generalized linear models contains many of these. In this class the linear predictor \$\textbackslash eta = \textbackslash Sigma \textbackslash beta\_jX\_j\$ is replaced by the additive predictor \$\textbackslash Sigma s\_j(X\_j)\$; hence, the name generalized additive models. We illustrate the technique with binary response and survival data. In both cases, the method proves to be useful in uncovering nonlinear covariate effects. It has the advantage of being completely automatic, i.e., no "detective work" is needed on the part of the statistician. As a theoretical underpinning, the technique is viewed as an empirical method of maximizing the expected log likelihood, or equivalently, of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler distance to the true model.},

  abstract = {The highly influential two-group model in testing a large number of statistical hypotheses assumes that the test statistics are drawn independently from a mixture of a high probability null distribution and a low probability alternative. Optimal control of the marginal false discovery rate (mFDR), in the sense that it provides maximal power (expected true discoveries) subject to mFDR control, is known to be achieved by thresholding the local false discovery rate (locFDR), the probability of the hypothesis being null given the set of test statistics, with a fixed threshold. We address the challenge of controlling optimally the popular false discovery rate (FDR) or positive FDR (pFDR) in the general two-group model, which also allows for dependence between the test statistics. These criteria are less conservative than the mFDR criterion, so they make more rejections in expectation. We derive their optimal multiple testing (OMT) policies, which turn out to be thresholding the locFDR with a threshold that is a function of the entire set of statistics. We develop an efficient algorithm for finding these policies, and use it for problems with thousands of hypotheses. We illustrate these procedures on gene expression studies.},

  abstract = {A central goal in designing clinical trials is to find the test that maximizes power (or equivalently minimizes required sample size) for finding a false null hypothesis subject to the constraint of type I error. When there is more than one test, such as in clinical trials with multiple endpoints, the issues of optimal design and optimal procedures become more complex. In this paper we address the question of how such optimal tests should be defined and how they can be found. We review different notions of power and how they relate to study goals, and also consider the requirements of type I error control and the nature of the procedures. This leads us to an explicit optimization problem with objective and constraints which describe its specific desiderata. We present a complete solution for deriving optimal procedures for two hypotheses, which have desired monotonicity properties, and are computationally simple. For some of the optimization formulations this yields optimal procedures that are identical to existing procedures, such as Hommel's procedure or the procedure of Bittman et al. (2009), while for others it yields completely novel and more powerful policies than existing ones. We demonstrate the nature of our novel policies and their improved power extensively in simulation and on the APEX study (Cohen et al., 2016).},

  abstract = {DNA methylation patterns are important for establishing cell, tissue, and organism phenotypes, but little is known about their contribution to natural human variation. To determine their contribution to variability, we have generated genome-scale DNA methylation profiles of three human populations (Caucasian-American, African-American, and Han Chinese-American) and examined the differentially methylated CpG sites. The distinctly methylated genes identified suggest an influence of DNA methylation on phenotype differences, such as susceptibility to certain diseases and pathogens, and response to drugs and environmental agents. DNA methylation differences can be partially traced back to genetic variation, suggesting that differentially methylated CpG sites serve as evolutionarily established mediators between the genetic code and phenotypic variability. Notably, one-third of the DNA methylation differences were not associated with any genetic variation, suggesting that variation in population-specific sites takes place at the genetic and epigenetic levels, highlighting the contribution of epigenetic modification to natural human variation.},

  abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) is a burgeoning field that involves the use of genetic variants to assess causal relationships between exposures and outcomes. MR studies can be straightforward; for example, genetic variants within or near the encoding locus that is associated with protein concentrations can help to assess their causal role in disease. However, a more complex relationship between the genetic variants and an exposure can make findings from MR more difficult to interpret. In this Review, we describe some of these challenges in interpreting MR analyses, including those from studies using genetic variants to assess causality of multiple traits (such as branched-chain amino acids and risk of diabetes mellitus); studies describing pleiotropic variants (for example, C-reactive protein and its contribution to coronary heart disease); and those investigating variants that disrupt normal function of an exposure (for example, HDL cholesterol or IL-6 and coronary heart disease). Furthermore, MR studies on variants that encode enzymes responsible for the metabolism of an exposure (such as alcohol) are discussed, in addition to those assessing the effects of variants on time-dependent exposures (extracellular superoxide dismutase), cumulative exposures (LDL cholesterol), and overlapping exposures (triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol). We elaborate on the molecular features of each relationship, and provide explanations for the likely causal associations. In doing so, we hope to contribute towards more reliable evaluations of MR findings.},

  abstract = {Although genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of risk loci for complex traits, only a handful of the biologically causal variants, responsible for association at these loci, have been successfully identified. Current statistical methods for identifying causal variants at risk loci either use the strength of the association signal in an iterative conditioning framework or estimate probabilities for variants to be causal. A main drawback of existing methods is that they rely on the simplifying assumption of a single causal variant at each risk locus, which is typically invalid at many risk loci. In this work, we propose a new statistical framework that allows for the possibility of an arbitrary number of causal variants when estimating the posterior probability of a variant being causal. A direct benefit of our approach is that we predict a set of variants for each locus that under reasonable assumptions will contain all of the true causal variants with a high confidence level (e.g., 95\%) even when the locus contains multiple causal variants. We use simulations to show that our approach provides 20–50\% improvement in our ability to identify the causal variants compared to the existing methods at loci harboring multiple causal variants. We validate our approach using empirical data from an expression QTL study of CHI3L2 to identify new causal variants that affect gene expression at this locus.

We show that these annotations are more strongly enriched for heritability (5.84× for eQTLs; P\,=\,1.19\,×\,10−31) across 41 diseases and complex traits than annotations containing all significant molecular QTLs (1.80× for expression (e)QTLs). eQTL annotations obtained by meta-analyzing all GTEx tissues generally performed best, whereas tissue-specific eQTL annotations produced stronger enrichments for blood- and brain-related diseases and traits. eQTL annotations restricted to loss-of-function intolerant genes were even more enriched for heritability (17.06×; P\,=\,1.20\,×\,10−35). All molecular QTLs except splicing QTLs remained significantly enriched in joint analysis, indicating that each of these annotations is uniquely informative for disease and complex trait architectures.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Individuals of admixed ancestries (e.g., African Americans) inherit a mosaic of ancestry segments (local ancestry) originating from multiple continental ancestral populations. Their genomic diversity offers the unique opportunity of investigating genetic effects on disease across multiple ancestries within the same population. Quantifying the similarity in causal effects across local ancestries is paramount to studying genetic basis of diseases in admixed individuals. Such similarity can be defined as the genetic correlation of causal effects (             r             admix             ) across African and European local ancestry backgrounds. Existing studies investigating causal effects variability across ancestries focused on cross-continental comparisons; however, such differences could be due to heterogeneities in the definition of environment/phenotype across continental ancestries. Studying genetic effects within admixed individuals avoids these confounding factors, because the genetic effects are compared across local ancestries within the same individuals. Here, we introduce a new method that models polygenic architecture of complex traits to quantify             r             admix             across local ancestries. We model genome-wide causal effects that are allowed to vary by ancestry and estimate             r             admix             by inferring variance components of local ancestry-aware genetic relationship matrices. Our method is accurate and robust across a range of simulations. We analyze 38 complex traits in individuals of African and European admixed ancestries (             N             = 53K) from: Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE), UK Biobank (UKBB) and             All of Us             (AoU). We observe a high similarity in causal effects by ancestry in meta-analyses across traits, with estimated             r             admix             =0.95 (95\% credible interval [0.93, 0.97]), much higher than correlation in causal effects across continental ancestries. High estimated             r             admix             is also observed consistently for each individual trait. We replicate the high correlation in causal effects using regression-based methods from marginal GWAS summary statistics. We also report realistic scenarios where regression-based methods yield inflated estimates of heterogeneity-by-ancestry due to local ancestry-specific tagging of causal variants, and/or polygenicity. Among regression-based methods, only Deming regression is robust enough for estimation of correlation in causal effects by ancestry. In summary, causal effects on complex traits are highly similar across local ancestries and motivate genetic analyses that assume minimal heterogeneity in causal effects by ancestry.},

While many computational methods have been developed to infer the pseudo-temporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, methods that compare pseudo-temporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions are lacking. Lamian is a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. It can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions, and also to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, Lamian draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both simulations and real scRNA-seq data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of Lamian in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes.},

  abstract = {Cellular heterogeneity in gene expression is driven by cellular processes, such as cell cycle and cell-type identity, and cellular environment such as spatial location. The cell cycle, in particular, is thought to be a key driver of cell-to-cell heterogeneity in gene expression, even in otherwise homogeneous cell populations. Recent advances in single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) facilitate detailed characterization of gene expression heterogeneity and can thus shed new light on the processes driving heterogeneity. Here, we combined fluorescence imaging with scRNA-seq to measure cell cycle phase and gene expression levels in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). By using these data, we developed a novel approach to characterize cell cycle progression. Although standard methods assign cells to discrete cell cycle stages, our method goes beyond this and quantifies cell cycle progression on a continuum. We found that, on average, scRNA-seq data from only five genes predicted a cell's position on the cell cycle continuum to within 14\% of the entire cycle and that using more genes did not improve this accuracy. Our data and predictor of cell cycle phase can directly help future studies to account for cell cycle–related heterogeneity in iPSCs. Our results and methods also provide a foundation for future work to characterize the effects of the cell cycle on expression heterogeneity in other cell types.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Mouse models are a critical tool for studying human diseases, particularly developmental disorders, as well as for advancing our general understanding of mammalian biology. However, it has long been suspected that conventional approaches for phenotyping are insufficiently sensitive to detect subtle defects throughout the developing mouse. Here we set out to establish single cell RNA sequencing (sc-RNA-seq) of the whole embryo as a scalable platform for the systematic molecular and cellular phenotyping of mouse genetic models. We applied combinatorial indexing-based sc-RNA-seq to profile 101 embryos of 26 genotypes at embryonic stage E13.5, altogether profiling gene expression in over 1.6M nuclei. The 26 genotypes include 22 mouse mutants representing a range of anticipated severities, from established multisystem disorders to deletions of individual enhancers, as well as the 4 wildtype backgrounds on which these mutants reside. We developed and applied several analytical frameworks for detecting differences in composition and/or gene expression across 52 cell types or trajectories. Some mutants exhibited changes in dozens of trajectories (             e.g.             , the pleiotropic consequences of altering the             Sox9             regulatory landscape) whereas others showed phenotypes affecting specific subsets of cells. We also identify differences between widely used wildtype strains, compare phenotyping of gain vs. loss of function mutants, and characterise deletions of topological associating domain (TAD) boundaries. Intriguingly, even among these 22 mutants, some changes are shared by heretofore unrelated models, suggesting that developmental pleiotropy might be “decomposable” through further scaling of this approach. Overall, our findings show how single cell profiling of whole embryos can enable the systematic molecular and cellular phenotypic characterization of mouse mutants with unprecedented breadth and resolution.},

The naive approach to parameter estimation is considered whereby observed covariate values are used, inappropriately, in the usual analysis instead of the underlying covariate values. A relationship between the estimated parameter in large samples and the true parameter is obtained showing that the bias does not depend on the form of the baseline hazard function when the errors are normally distributed. With high censorship, adjustment of the naive estimate by the factor 1 + λ, where λ is the ratio of within-person variability about an underlying mean level to the variability of these levels in the population sampled, removes the bias. As censorship increases, the adjustment required increases and when there is no censorship is markedly higher than 1 + λ and depends also on the true risk relationship.},

  abstract = {Colocalization analysis has emerged as a powerful tool to uncover the overlapping of causal variants responsible for both molecular and complex disease phenotypes. The findings from colocalization analysis yield insights into the molecular pathways of complex diseases. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the promise and limitations of the available colocalization analysis approaches. Focusing on variant-level colocalization approaches, we first establish the connections between various existing methods. We proceed to discuss the impacts of various controllable analytical factors and uncontrollable practical factors on outcomes of colocalization analysis through realistic simulations and real data examples. We identify a single analytical factor, the specification of prior enrichment levels, which can lead to severe inflation of false-positive colocalization findings. Meanwhile, the combination of many other analytical and practical factors all lead to diminished power. Consequently, we recommend the following strategies for the best practice of colocalization analysis: (1) estimating prior enrichment level from the observed data and (2) separating fine-mapping and colocalization analysis. Our analysis of 4,091 complex traits and the multi-tissue expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from the GTEx (v.8) suggests that colocalizations of molecular QTLs and causal complex trait associations are widespread. However, only a small proportion can be confidently identified from currently available data due to a lack of power. Our findings set a benchmark for current and future integrative genetic association analysis applications.},

  abstract = {Genetic risk prediction is an important goal in human genetics research and precision medicine. Accurate prediction models will have great impacts on both disease prevention and early treatment strategies. Despite the identification of thousands of disease-associated genetic variants through genome wide association studies (GWAS), genetic risk prediction accuracy remains moderate for most diseases, which is largely due to the challenges in both identifying all the functionally relevant variants and accurately estimating their effect sizes in the presence of linkage disequilibrium. In this paper, we introduce AnnoPred, a principled framework that leverages diverse types of genomic and epigenomic functional annotations in genetic risk prediction for complex diseases. AnnoPred is trained using GWAS summary statistics in a Bayesian framework in which we explicitly model various functional annotations and allow for linkage disequilibrium estimated from reference genotype data. Compared with state-of-the-art risk prediction methods, AnnoPred achieves consistently improved prediction accuracy in both extensive simulations and real data.},

More broadly, we study how to combine an e-value and a p-value, and design multiple testing procedures where both e-values and p-values are available for every hypothesis. For false discovery rate control, analogous to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure with p-values (p-BH) and the recent e-BH procedure for e-values, we propose two new procedures: ep-BH and pe-BH with finite sample validity under different dependence assumptions. These procedures are designed based on several admissible combining functions for p/e-values, which also yield methods for family-wise error rate control.

A common statistical approach is to quantify the interest of each gene with a p-value, adjust these p-values for multiple comparisons, chose an appropriate cut-off, and create a list of candidate genes. This approach has been criticized for ignoring biological knowledge regarding how genes work together. Recently a series of methods, that do incorporate biological knowledge, have been proposed. However, many of these methods seem overly complicated. Furthermore, the most popular method, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), is based on a statistical test known for its lack of sensitivity. In this paper we compare the performance of a simple alternative to GSEA. We find that this simple solution clearly outperforms GSEA. We demonstrate this with eight different microarray datasets.},

  abstract = {In some applications (e.g., in cosmology and economics), the regression E[Z|x] is not adequate to represent the association between a predictor x and a response Z because of multi-modality and asymmetry of f(z|x); using the full density instead of a single-point estimate can then lead to less bias in subsequent analysis. As of now, there are no effective ways of estimating f(z|x) when x represents high-dimensional, complex data. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric estimator of f(z|x) that adapts to sparse (low-dimensional) structure in x. By directly expanding f(z|x) in the eigenfunctions of a kernel-based operator, we avoid tensor products in high dimensions as well as ratios of estimated densities. Our basis functions are orthogonal with respect to the underlying data distribution, allowing fast implementation and tuning of parameters. We derive rates of convergence and show that the method adapts to the intrinsic dimension of the data. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of the series method on images, spectra, and an application to photometric redshift estimation of galaxies.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful means to identify loci and genes contributing to disease, but in many cases the related cell types/states through which genes confer disease risk remain unknown. Deciphering such relationships is important for identifying pathogenic processes and developing therapeutics. Here, we introduce sc-linker, a framework for integrating single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq), epigenomic maps and GWAS summary statistics to infer the underlying cell types and processes by which genetic variants influence disease. We analyzed 1.6 million scRNA-seq profiles from 209 individuals spanning 11 tissue types and 6 disease conditions, and constructed gene programs capturing cell types, disease progression, and cellular processes both within and across cell types. We evaluated these gene programs for disease enrichment by transforming them to SNP annotations with tissue-specific epigenomic maps and computing enrichment scores across 60 diseases and complex traits (average N=297K). Cell type, disease progression, and cellular process programs captured distinct heritability signals even within the same cell type, as we show in multiple complex diseases that affect the brain (Alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis), colon (ulcerative colitis) and lung (asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, severe COVID-19). The inferred disease enrichments recapitulated known biology and highlighted novel cell-disease relationships, including GABAergic neurons in major depressive disorder (MDD), a disease progression M cell program in ulcerative colitis, and a disease-specific complement cascade process in multiple sclerosis. In autoimmune disease, both healthy and disease progression immune cell type programs were associated, whereas for epithelial cells, disease progression programs were most prominent, perhaps suggesting a role in disease progression over initiation. Our framework provides a powerful approach for identifying the cell types and cellular processes by which genetic variants influence disease.},

We exhibit and theoretically explore various fitting procedures for which the degrees of freedom is not monotonic in the model complexity parameter and can exceed the total dimension of the ambient space even in very simple settings. We show that the degrees of freedom for any nonconvex projection method can be unbounded.},

The proportion of neurons produced by each cell line is highly reproducible and is predictable by robust molecular markers expressed in pluripotent cells. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) were characterized at different stages of neuronal development and in response to rotenone-induced oxidative stress. Of these, 1,284 eQTL colocalize with known neurological trait risk loci, and 46\% are not found in the Genotype–Tissue Expression (GTEx) catalog. Our study illustrates how coupling scRNA-seq with long-term iPSC differentiation enables mechanistic studies of human trait-associated genetic variants in otherwise inaccessible cell states.},

  abstract = {Bayesian classification commonly relies on probit models, with data augmentation algorithms used for posterior computation. By imputing latent Gaussian variables, one can often trivially adapt computational approaches used in Gaussian models. However, MCMC for multinomial probit (MNP) models can be inefficient in practice due to high posterior dependence between latent variables and parameters, and to difficulties in efficiently sampling latent variables when there are more than two categories. To address these problems, we propose a new class of diagonal orthant (DO) multinomial models. The key characteristics of these models include conditional independence of the latent variables given model parameters, avoidance of arbitrary identifiability restrictions, and simple expressions for category probabilities. We show substantially improved computational efficiency and comparable predictive performance to MNP.},

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model.

  abstract = {This paper presents a tutorial introduction to the use of variational methods for inference and learning in graphical models (Bayesian networks and Markov random fields). We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case.},

We demonstrate the power of Symphony in multiple real-world datasets, including (1) mapping a multi-donor, multi-species query to predict pancreatic cell types, (2) localizing query cells along a developmental trajectory of fetal liver hematopoiesis, and (3) inferring surface protein expression with a multimodal CITE-seq atlas of memory T cells.},

We present a new approximate learning algorithm for Boltzmann machines, based on mean-field theory and the linear response theorem. The computational complexity of the algorithm is cubic in the number of neurons. In the absence of hidden units, we show how the weights can be directly computed from the fixed-point equation of the learning rules. Thus, in this case we do not need to use a gradient descent procedure for the learning process. We show that the solutions of this method are close to the optimal solutions and give a significant improvement when correlations play a significant role. Finally, we apply the method to a pattern completion task and show good performance for networks up to 100 neurons.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian Central Limit Theorem (BCLT) for finite-dimensional models, also known as the Bernstein -- von Mises Theorem, is a primary motivation for the widely-used Laplace approximation. But currently the BCLT is expressed only in terms of total variation (TV) distance and lacks non-asymptotic bounds on the rate of convergence that are readily computable in applications. Likewise, the Laplace approximation is not equipped with non-asymptotic quality guarantees for the vast classes of posteriors for which it is asymptotically valid. To understand its quality and real-problem applicability, we need finite-sample bounds that can be computed for a given model and data set. And to understand the quality of posterior mean and variance estimates, we need bounds on divergences alternative to the TV distance. Our work provides the first closed-form, finite-sample bounds for the quality of the Laplace approximation that do not require log concavity of the posterior or an exponential-family likelihood. We bound not only the TV distance but also (A) the Wasserstein-1 distance, which controls error in a posterior mean estimate, and (B) an integral probability metric that controls the error in a posterior variance estimate. We compute exact constants in our bounds for a variety of standard models, including logistic regression, and numerically investigate the utility of our bounds. And we provide a framework for analysis of more complex models.},

Suppose that the hypothesis H\textsubscript{0}: ψ = ψ\textsubscript{0} is to be tested against H\textsubscript{A}: ψ ≠ ψ\textsubscript{0} in the presence of a nuisance parameter β, and initially priors π\textsubscript{0}(β) under H\textsubscript{0} and π(β,ψ) under H\textsubscript{A} are used. We consider the problem of assessing sensitivity of the Bayes factor to small changes in π\textsubscript{0} and π. We show that for local alternatives (which, for moderate sample sizes, are consistent with small or moderately large values of the Bayes factor in favour of the alternative), if β and ψ are what we call 'null orthogonal' parameters, then alterations in π\textsubscript{0} have no effect on the Bayes factor up to order O(n\textsuperscript{-1}). Under similar conditions we also derive an order O(n\textsuperscript{-1}) approximation to the minimum Bayes factor over all priors π under H\textsubscript{A} such that the marginal prior on ψ is normal with mean ψ\textsubscript{0}. We then go on to consider sensitivity to specific changes in the marginal prior on ψ and show how asymptotics may be used for this, applying a second-order approximation due to Tierney and Kadane. We illustrate the results with a test of equality of two binomial proportions and briefly investigate the accuracy of the approximations is this context.},

In this paper, we propose a new class of such simultaneous FDP bounds, tailored for nested sequences of rejection sets. While most existing simultaneous FDP bounds are based on closed testing using global null tests based on sorted p-values, we additionally consider the setting where side information can be leveraged to boost power, the variable selection setting where knockoff statistics can be used to order variables, and the online setting where decisions about rejections must be made as data arrives. Our finite-sample, closed form bounds are based on repurposing the FDP estimates from false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedures designed for each of the above settings. These results establish a novel connection between the parallel literatures of simultaneous FDP bounds and FDR control methods, and use proof techniques employing martingales and filtrations that are new to both these literatures. We demonstrate the utility of our results by augmenting a recent knockoffs analysis of the UK Biobank dataset.},

The higher order functional information is stored in the PATHWAY database, which contains graphical representations of cellular processes, such as metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and cell cycle. The PATHWAY database is supplemented by a set of ortholog group tables for the information about conserved subpathways (pathway motifs), which are often encoded by positionally coupled genes on the chromosome and which are especially useful in predicting gene functions. A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

To understand how signaling networks process dynamic inputs into gene expression outputs and the role of noise in cellular information processing, we studied the immune pathway NF-kB under periodic cytokine inputs using microfluidic single-cell measurements and stochastic modeling. We find that NF-kB dynamics in fibroblasts synchronize with oscillating TNF signal and become entrained, leading to significantly increased NF-kB oscillation amplitude and mRNA output compared to non-entrained response. Simulations show that intrinsic biochemical noise in individual cells improves NF-kB oscillation and entrainment, whereas cell-to-cell variability in NF-kB natural frequency creates population robustness, together enabling entrainment over a wider range of dynamic inputs. This wide range is confirmed by experiments where entrained cells were measured under all input periods. These results indicate that synergy between oscillation and noise allows cells to achieve efficient gene expression in dynamically changing signaling environments.},

  abstract = {In a microarray experiment, messenger RNA samples are oftentimes pooled across subjects out of necessity, or in an effort to reduce the effect of biological variation. A basic problem in such experiments is to estimate the nominal expression levels of a large number of genes. Pooling samples will affect expression estimation, but the exact effects are not yet known as the approach has not been systematically studied in this context. We consider how mRNA pooling affects expression estimates by assessing the finite-sample performance of different estimators for designs with and without pooling. Conditions under which it is advantageous to pool mRNA are defined; and general properties of estimates from both pooled and non-pooled designs are derived under these conditions. A formula is given for the total number of subjects and arrays required in a pooled experiment to obtain gene expression estimates and confidence intervals comparable to those obtained from the no-pooling case. The formula demonstrates that by pooling a perhaps increased number of subjects, one can decrease the number of arrays required in an experiment without a loss of precision. The assumptions that facilitate derivation of this formula are considered using data from a quantitative real-time PCR experiment. The calculations are not specific to one particular method of quantifying gene expression as they assume only that a single, normalized, estimate of expression is obtained for each gene. As such, the results should be generally applicable to a number of technologies provided sufficient pre-processing and normalization methods are available and applied.},

  abstract = {Many gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies have published their summary statistics, which can be used to gain insight into complex human traits by downstream analyses, such as fine mapping and co-localization. However, technical differences between these datasets are a barrier to their widespread use. Consequently, target genes for most genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals have still not been identified. In the present study, we present the eQTL Catalogue (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl), a resource of quality-controlled, uniformly re-computed gene expression and splicing QTLs from 21 studies. We find that, for matching cell types and tissues, the eQTL effect sizes are highly reproducible between studies. Although most QTLs were shared between most bulk tissues, we identified a greater diversity of cell-type-specific QTLs from purified cell types, a subset of which also manifested as new disease co-localizations. Our summary statistics are freely available to enable the systematic interpretation of human GWAS associations across many cell types and tissues.},

We thoroughly compare our approach to existing algorithms for multinomial logit/probit likelihoods on several problems, including inference in multinomial Gaussian process classification and learning in latent factor models.

  abstract = {Summary: Independent of the platform and the analysis methods used, the result of a microarray experiment is, in most cases, a list of differentially expressed genes. An automatic ontological analysis approach has been recently proposed to help with the biological interpretation of such results. Currently, this approach is the de facto standard for the secondary analysis of high throughput experiments and a large number of tools have been developed for this purpose. We present a detailed comparison of 14 such tools using the following criteria: scope of the analysis, visualization capabilities, statistical model(s) used, correction for multiple comparisons, reference microarrays available, installation issues and sources of annotation data. This detailed analysis of the capabilities of these tools will help researchers choose the most appropriate tool for a given type of analysis. More importantly, in spite of the fact that this type of analysis has been generally adopted, this approach has several important intrinsic drawbacks. These drawbacks are associated with all tools discussed and represent conceptual limitations of the current state-of-the-art in ontological analysis. We propose these as challenges for the next generation of secondary data analysis tools.},

Although often attributed to unhealthy lifestyle choices or environmental factors, obesity is known to be heritable and highly polygenic; the majority of inherited susceptibility is related to the cumulative effect of many common DNA variants. Here we derive and validate a new polygenic predictor comprised of 2.1 million common variants to quantify this susceptibility and test this predictor in more than 300,000 individuals ranging from middle age to birth. Among middle-aged adults, we observe a 13-kg gradient in weight and a 25-fold gradient in risk of severe obesity across polygenic score deciles. In a longitudinal birth cohort, we note minimal differences in birthweight across score deciles, but a significant gradient emerged in early childhood and reached 12~kg by 18 years of age. This new approach to quantify inherited susceptibility to obesity affords new opportunities for clinical prevention and mechanistic assessment.},

  abstract = {A major goal in the field of transcriptional regulation is the mapping of changes in the binding of transcription factors to the resultant changes in gene expression. Recently, methods for measuring chromatin accessibility have enabled us to measure changes in accessibility across the genome, which are thought to correspond to transcription factor binding events. In concert with RNA-sequencing, these data in principle enable such mappings; however, few studies have looked at their concordance over short duration treatments with specific perturbations. Here, we used tandem, bulk ATAC-seq and RNA-seq measurements from MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells to systematically evaluate the concordance between changes in accessibility and changes in expression in response to retinoic acid and TGF-β. We found two classes of genes whose expression showed a significant change: those that showed some change in accessibility of nearby chromatin, and those that showed virtually no change despite strong changes in expression. The peaks associated with genes in the former group had a lower baseline accessibility prior to exposure to signal. Focusing the analysis specifically on peaks with motifs for transcription factors associated with retinoic acid and TGF-β signaling did not reduce the lack of correspondence. Analysis of paired chromatin accessibility and gene expression data from distinct paths along the hematopoietic differentiation trajectory showed a much stronger correspondence, suggesting that the multifactorial biological processes associated with differentiation may lead to changes in chromatin accessibility that reflect rather than drive altered transcriptional status. Together, these results show many gene expression changes can happen independent of changes in accessibility of local chromatin in the context of a single-factor perturbation and suggest that some changes to accessibility changes may occur after changes to expression, rather than before.},

Risk loci are typically dissected through fine-mapping experiments in trans-ethnic cohorts for leveraging the variability in the local genetic structure across populations. More recent works have shown that genomic functional annotations (i.e., localization of tissue-specific regulatory marks) can be integrated for increasing fine-mapping performance within single-population studies. Here, we introduce methods that integrate the strength of association between genotype and phenotype, the variability in the genetic backgrounds across populations, and the genomic map of tissue-specific functional elements to increase trans-ethnic fine-mapping accuracy. Through extensive simulations and empirical data, we have demonstrated that our approach increases fine-mapping resolution over existing methods. We analyzed empirical data from a large-scale trans-ethnic rheumatoid arthritis (RA) study and showed that the functional genetic architecture of RA is consistent across European and Asian ancestries. In these data, we used our proposed methods to reduce the average size of the 90\% credible set from 29 variants per locus for standard non-integrative approaches to 22 variants.},

  abstract = {Maximum likelihood estimation of mixture proportions has a long history, and continues to play an important role in modern statistics, including in development of nonparametric empirical Bayes methods. Maximum likelihood of mixture proportions has traditionally been solved using the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, but recent work by Koenker \& Mizera shows that modern convex optimization techniques -- in particular, interior point methods -- are substantially faster and more accurate than EM. Here, we develop a new solution based on sequential quadratic programming (SQP). It is substantially faster than the interior point method, and just as accurate. Our approach combines several ideas: first, it solves a reformulation of the original problem; second, it uses an SQP approach to make the best use of the expensive gradient and Hessian computations; third, the SQP iterations are implemented using an active set method to exploit the sparse nature of the quadratic subproblems; fourth, it uses accurate low-rank approximations for more efficient gradient and Hessian computations. We illustrate the benefits of our approach in experiments on synthetic data sets as well as a large genetic association data set. In large data sets (n = 1,000,000 observations, m = 1,000 mixture components), our implementation achieves at least 100-fold reduction in runtime compared with a state-of-the-art interior point solver. Our methods are implemented in Julia, and in an R package available on CRAN (see https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mixsqp).},

Combining these two ideas results in fast and flexible methods, with computational speed comparable to fast penalized regression methods such as the Lasso, and with superior prediction accuracy across a wide range of scenarios. Furthermore, we show that the posterior mean from our method can be interpreted as solving a penalized regression problem, with the precise form of the penalty function being learned from the data by directly solving an optimization problem (rather than being tuned by cross-validation).

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate local permutation tests for testing conditional independence between two random vectors \$X\$ and \$Y\$ given \$Z\$. The local permutation test determines the significance of a test statistic by locally shuffling samples which share similar values of the conditioning variables \$Z\$, and it forms a natural extension of the usual permutation approach for unconditional independence testing. Despite its simplicity and empirical support, the theoretical underpinnings of the local permutation test remain unclear. Motivated by this gap, this paper aims to establish theoretical foundations of local permutation tests with a particular focus on binning-based statistics. We start by revisiting the hardness of conditional independence testing and provide an upper bound for the power of any valid conditional independence test, which holds when the probability of observing collisions in \$Z\$ is small. This negative result naturally motivates us to impose additional restrictions on the possible distributions under the null and alternate. To this end, we focus our attention on certain classes of smooth distributions and identify provably tight conditions under which the local permutation method is universally valid, i.e. it is valid when applied to any (binning-based) test statistic. To complement this result on type I error control, we also show that in some cases, a binning-based statistic calibrated via the local permutation method can achieve minimax optimal power. We also introduce a double-binning permutation strategy, which yields a valid test over less smooth null distributions than the typical single-binning method without compromising much power. Finally, we present simulation results to support our theoretical findings.},

To do this, we demonstrate that these methods-which we collectively refer to as Markov chain score ascent (MCSA) methods-can be cast as special cases of the Markov chain gradient descent framework. Furthermore, by leveraging this new understanding, we develop a novel MCSA scheme, parallel MCSA (pMCSA), that achieves a tighter bound on the gradient variance.

The J+aB offers a predictive coverage guarantee that holds with no assumptions on the distribution of the data, the nature of the fitted model, or the way in which the ensemble of models are aggregated---at worst, the failure rate of the predictive interval is inflated by a factor of 2.

  abstract = {Bayesian inference for latent factor models, such as principal component and canonical correlation analysis, is easy for Gaussian likelihoods. In particular, full conjugacy makes both Gibbs samplers and mean-field variational approximations straightforward. For other likelihood potentials one needs to either resort to more complex sampling schemes or to specifying dedicated forms of variational lower bounds. Recently, however, it was shown that for specific likelihoods related to the logistic function it is possible to augment the joint density with auxiliary variables following a Polya-Gamma distribution, leading to closed-form updates for binary and over-dispersed count models. In this paper we describe how Gibbs sampling and mean-field variational approximation for various latent factor models can be implemented for these cases, presenting easy-to-implement and efficient inference schemas.},

  abstract = {A test-statistic typically employed in the gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) prevents this method from being genuinely multivariate. In particular, this statistic is insensitive to changes in the correlation structure of the gene sets of interest. The present paper considers the utility of an alternative test-statistic in designing the confirmatory component of the GSEA. This statistic is based on a pertinent distance between joint distributions of expression levels of genes included in the set of interest. The null distribution of the proposed test-statistic, known as the multivariate N-statistic, is obtained by permuting group labels. Our simulation studies and analysis of biological data confirm the conjecture that the N-statistic is a much better choice for multivariate significance testing within the framework of the GSEA. We also discuss some other aspects of the GSEA paradigm and suggest new avenues for future research.}

However, the genetic basis of sensitivity to anthracyclines remains unclear. We created a panel of iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from 45 individuals and performed RNA-seq after 24 hr exposure to varying doxorubicin dosages. The transcriptomic response is substantial: the majority of genes are differentially expressed and over 6000 genes show evidence of differential splicing, the later driven by reduced splicing fidelity in the presence of doxorubicin. We show that inter-individual variation in transcriptional response is predictive of in vitro cell damage, which in turn is associated with in vivo ACT risk. We detect 447 response-expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) and 42 response-splicing QTLs, which are enriched in lower ACT GWAS                                p                              -values, supporting the in vivo relevance of our map of genetic regulation of cellular response to anthracyclines.                        ,              Many cancers, including leukaemia, lymphoma and breast cancer, are treated with potent chemotherapy drugs such as anthracyclines. However, anthracyclines have strong side effects known as anthracycline cardiotoxicity, which affect the health of the heart. Almost half of the patients given high doses of anthracyclines develop chronic heart failure.             While anthracycline cardiotoxicity is very common, people’s genes may contribute to how sensitive they are to these drugs but it is not understood which genes can cause this effect. Previous studies using only a small number of participants have not been able to pin down the genetic factors that make some patients respond well to anthracyclines, and others prone to developing heart failure when taking these drugs.             To find out which genes affect anthracycline cardiotoxicity, Knowles, Burrows et al. transformed blood cells from 45 individuals into stem cells, which were then developed into heart muscle cells. Then, the activity of genes was analyzed by measuring the amount of RNA (the template molecules used to make proteins) produced by those genes.             After the cells had been exposed for 24 hours to the anthracycline drug doxorubicin, hundreds of gene activity differences could be found in the heart muscle cells between individuals. Some of these differences were linked to poorer health of the cells after treatment with the drug. As a result, a number of genetic variants that could predispose patients to the side effects of doxorubicin were discovered. The experiments also revealed how doxorubicin disrupts an important process that separates ‘junk’ parts of the RNA from the parts that are used as a template for proteins.             Being able to predict who is likely to be sensitive to drugs such as doxorubicin could help doctors to tailor chemotherapy treatments more effectively, minimising the risk of heart failure. In future, larger studies could lead to accurate predictions of a patient’s response to a particular chemotherapy drug to personalize their cancer treatment.},

We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expectations are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regression. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the softmax factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants provide a nurturing environment Genetic variants in parents may affect the fitness of their offspring, even if the child does not carry the allele. This indirect effect is referred to as “genetic nurture.” Kong et al. used data from genome-wide association studies of educational attainment to construct polygenic scores for parents that only considered the nontransmitted alleles (see the Perspective by Koellinger and Harden). The findings suggest that genetic nurture is ultimately due to genetic variation in the population and is mediated by the environment that parents create for their children. Science, this issue p. 424; see also p. 386 Sequence variants in the parental genomes that are not transmitted to a child (the proband) are often ignored in genetic studies. Here we show that nontransmitted alleles can affect a child through their impacts on the parents and other relatives, a phenomenon we call “genetic nurture.” Using results from a meta-analysis of educational attainment, we find that the polygenic score computed for the nontransmitted alleles of 21,637 probands with at least one parent genotyped has an estimated effect on the educational attainment of the proband that is 29.9\% (P = 1.6 × 10−14) of that of the transmitted polygenic score. Genetic nurturing effects of this polygenic score extend to other traits. Paternal and maternal polygenic scores have similar effects on educational attainment, but mothers contribute more than fathers to nutrition- and heath-related traits. Behavioral genetics can transmit an environmental effect from parents and other related caregivers to their children.

  abstract = {Population isolates such as those in Finland benefit genetic research because deleterious alleles are often concentrated on a small number of low-frequency variants (0.1\%\,≤\,minor allele frequency\,{$<$}\,5\%). These variants survived the founding bottleneck rather than being distributed over a large number of ultrarare variants. Although this effect is well established in Mendelian genetics, its value in common disease genetics is less explored1,2. FinnGen aims to study the genome and national health register data of 500,000 Finnish individuals. Given the relatively high median age of participants (63\,years) and the substantial fraction of hospital-based recruitment, FinnGen is enriched for disease end points. Here we analyse data from 224,737 participants from FinnGen and study 15 diseases that have previously been investigated in large genome-wide association studies (GWASs). We also include meta-analyses of biobank data from Estonia and the United Kingdom. We identified 30 new associations, primarily low-frequency variants, enriched in the Finnish population. A GWAS of 1,932 diseases also identified 2,733 genome-wide significant associations (893 phenome-wide significant (PWS), P\,{$<$}\,2.6\,×\,10–11) at 2,496 (771 PWS) independent loci with 807 (247 PWS) end points. Among these, fine-mapping implicated 148 (73 PWS) coding variants associated with 83 (42 PWS) end points. Moreover, 91 (47 PWS) had an allele frequency of {$<$}5\% in non-Finnish European individuals, of which 62 (32 PWS) were enriched by more than twofold in Finland. These findings demonstrate the power of bottlenecked populations to find entry points into the biology of common diseases through low-frequency, high impact variants.},

However, this is not straightforward for noisy single-cell data where many counts are zero. We present a novel approach where expression values are summed across pools of cells, and the summed values are used for normalization. Pool-based size factors are then deconvolved to yield cell-based factors. Our deconvolution approach outperforms existing methods for accurate normalization of cell-specific biases in simulated data. Similar behavior is observed in real data, where deconvolution improves the relevance of results of downstream analyses.},

  abstract = {RNA abundance is a powerful indicator of the state of individual cells. Single-cell RNA sequencing can reveal RNA abundance with high quantitative accuracy, sensitivity and throughput1. However, this approach captures only a static snapshot at a point in time, posing a challenge for the analysis of time-resolved phenomena such as embryogenesis or tissue regeneration. Here we show that RNA velocity—the time derivative of the gene expression state—can be directly estimated by distinguishing between unspliced and spliced mRNAs in common single-cell RNA sequencing protocols. RNA velocity is a high-dimensional vector that predicts the future state of individual cells on a timescale of hours. We validate its accuracy in the neural crest lineage, demonstrate its use on multiple published datasets and technical platforms, reveal the branching lineage tree of the developing mouse hippocampus, and examine the kinetics of transcription in human embryonic brain. We expect RNA velocity to greatly aid the analysis of developmental lineages and cellular dynamics, particularly in humans.},

  abstract = {Estimating the rank of a corrupted data matrix is an important task in data analysis, most notably for choosing the number of components in principal component analysis. Significant progress on this task was achieved using random matrix theory by characterizing the spectral properties of large noise matrices. However, utilizing such tools is not straightforward when the data matrix consists of count random variables, e.g., a Poisson matrix, in which case the noise can be heteroskedastic with an unknown variance in each entry. In this work, we focus on a Poisson random matrix with independent entries and propose a simple procedure, termed biwhitening, for estimating the rank of the underlying signal matrix (i.e., the Poisson parameter matrix) without any prior knowledge. Our approach is based on the key observation that one can scale the rows and columns of the data matrix simultaneously so that the spectrum of the corresponding noise agrees with the standard Marchenko--Pastur (MP) law, justifying the use of the MP upper edge as a threshold for rank selection. Importantly, the required scaling factors can be estimated directly from the observations by solving a matrix scaling problem via the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm. Aside from the Poisson, our approach is extended to families of distributions that satisfy a quadratic relation between the mean and the variance, such as the generalized Poisson, binomial, negative binomial, gamma, and many others. This quadratic relation can also account for missing entries in the data. We conduct numerical experiments that corroborate our theoretical findings, and showcase the advantage of our approach for rank estimation in challenging regimes. Furthermore, we demonstrate the favorable performance of our approach on several real datasets of single-cell RNA sequencing, high-throughput chromosome conformation capture, and document topic modeling.},

The eukaryotic cell arose from prokaryotes just once in four billion years, and otherwise prokaryotes show no tendency to evolve greater complexity. Why not? Prokaryotic genome size is constrained by bioenergetics. The endosymbiosis that gave rise to mitochondria restructured the distribution of DNA in relation to bioenergetic membranes, permitting a remarkable 200,000-fold expansion in the number of genes expressed. This vast leap in genomic capacity was strictly dependent on mitochondrial power, and prerequisite to eukaryote complexity: the key innovation en route to multicellular life.}

We discover extremely widespread genetic variation affecting the regulation of most genes, with transcript structure and expression level variation being equally common but genetically largely independent. Our characterization of causal regulatory variation sheds light on the cellular mechanisms of regulatory and loss-of-function variation, and allows us to infer putative causal variants for dozens of disease-associated loci.

  abstract = {In Genomewide association (GWA) studies investigating thousands of SNPs, large sample sizes are needed to obtain a reasonable power after correction for multiple testing. To obtain the necessary sample sizes, data from different populations/cohorts are combined. The problem of pooling evidence across cohorts bears some resemblance with meta-analysis of clinical trials, and in fact classical meta-analytic methodologies from that field are typically used in GWAs. However, in genetics, it can be expected that the cohorts show some amount of heterogeneity in the association measures that are used for significance testing. In this paper, we demonstrate how it is possible to exploit this heterogeneity to improve our ability to detect influential genetic variants. We also discuss how pathway analysis based on summary data can help resolve heterogeneity. The current standard method for testing SNPs across cohorts in GWAs will miss heterogeneous but important genetic variants affecting complex diseases. Our new testing strategy has the potential to detect them while maintaining sensitivity to variants with homogeneous effects.},

  abstract = {L1 regularized logistic regression is now a workhorse of machine learning: it is widely used for many classification problems, particularly ones with many features. L1 regularized logistic regression requires solving a convex optimization problem. However, standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems do not scale well enough to handle the large datasets encountered in many practical settings. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for L1 regularized logistic regression. Our algorithm iteratively approximates the objective function by a quadratic approximation at the current point, while maintaining the L1 constraint. In each iteration, it uses the efficient LARS (Least Angle Regression) algorithm to solve the resulting L1 constrained quadratic optimization problem. Our theoretical results show that our algorithm is guaranteed to converge to the global optimum. Our experiments show that our algorithm significantly outperforms standard algorithms for solving convex optimization problems. Moreover, our algorithm outperforms four previously published algorithms that were specifically designed to solve the L1 regularized logistic regression problem.},

For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10\,independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3\% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11–13\% of the variance in educational attainment and 7–10\% of the variance in cognitive performance. This prediction accuracy substantially increases the utility of polygenic scores as tools in research.},

INRICH has wide applicability, fast running time and, most importantly, robustness to potential genomic biases and confounding factors. Such factors, including varying gene size and single-nucleotide polymorphism density, linkage disequilibrium within and between genes and overlapping genes with similar annotations, are often not accounted for by existing gene-set enrichment methods. By using a genomic permutation procedure, we generate experiment-wide empirical significance values, corrected for the total number of sets tested, implicitly taking overlap of sets into account. By simulation we confirm a properly controlled type I error rate and reasonable power of INRICH under diverse parameter settings. As a proof of principle, we describe the application of INRICH on the NHGRI GWAS catalog.Availability: A standalone C++ program, user manual and datasets can be freely downloaded from: http://atgu.mgh.harvard.edu/inrich/.Contact:shaun@atgu.mgh.harvard.eduSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide RNA expression data provide a detailed view of an organism's biological state; hence, a dataset measuring expression variation between genetically diverse individuals (eQTL data) may provide important insights into the genetics of complex traits. However, with data from a relatively small number of individuals, it is difficult to distinguish true causal polymorphisms from the large number of possibilities. The problem is particularly challenging in populations with significant linkage disequilibrium, where traits are often linked to large chromosomal regions containing many genes. Here, we present a novel method, Lirnet, that automatically learns a regulatory potential for each sequence polymorphism, estimating how likely it is to have a significant effect on gene expression. This regulatory potential is defined in terms of “regulatory features”—including the function of the gene and the conservation, type, and position of genetic polymorphisms—that are available for any organism. The extent to which the different features influence the regulatory potential is learned automatically, making Lirnet readily applicable to different datasets, organisms, and feature sets. We apply Lirnet both to the human HapMap eQTL dataset and to a yeast eQTL dataset and provide statistical and biological results demonstrating that Lirnet produces significantly better regulatory programs than other recent approaches. We demonstrate in the yeast data that Lirnet can correctly suggest a specific causal sequence variation within a large, linked chromosomal region. In one example, Lirnet uncovered a novel, experimentally validated connection between Puf3—a sequence-specific RNA binding protein—and P-bodies—cytoplasmic structures that regulate translation and RNA stability—as well as the particular causative polymorphism, a SNP in Mkt1, that induces the variation in the pathway.},

  abstract = {By aggregating data for complex traits in a biologically meaningful way, gene and gene-set analysis constitute a valuable addition to single-marker analysis. However, although various methods for gene and gene-set analysis currently exist, they generally suffer from a number of issues. Statistical power for most methods is strongly affected by linkage disequilibrium between markers, multi-marker associations are often hard to detect, and the reliance on permutation to compute p-values tends to make the analysis computationally very expensive. To address these issues we have developed MAGMA, a novel tool for gene and gene-set analysis. The gene analysis is based on a multiple regression model, to provide better statistical performance. The gene-set analysis is built as a separate layer around the gene analysis for additional flexibility. This gene-set analysis also uses a regression structure to allow generalization to analysis of continuous properties of genes and simultaneous analysis of multiple gene sets and other gene properties. Simulations and an analysis of Crohn’s Disease data are used to evaluate the performance of MAGMA and to compare it to a number of other gene and gene-set analysis tools. The results show that MAGMA has significantly more power than other tools for both the gene and the gene-set analysis, identifying more genes and gene sets associated with Crohn’s Disease while maintaining a correct type 1 error rate. Moreover, the MAGMA analysis of the Crohn’s Disease data was found to be considerably faster as well.},

For large-scale problems, adaptively focusing power on the more promising hypotheses (those more likely to yield discoveries) can lead to much more powerful multiple-testing procedures. We propose a general iterative framework for this problem, the adaptive p-value thresholding procedure which we call AdaPT, which adaptively estimates a Bayes optimal p-value rejection threshold and controls the false discovery rate in finite samples. At each iteration of the procedure, the analyst proposes a rejection threshold and observes partially censored p-values, estimates the false discovery proportion below the threshold and proposes another threshold, until the estimated false discovery proportion is below α. Our procedure is adaptive in an unusually strong sense, permitting the analyst to use any statistical or machine learning method she chooses to estimate the optimal threshold, and to switch between different models at each iteration as information accrues. We demonstrate the favourable performance of AdaPT by comparing it with state of the art methods in five real applications and two simulation studies.},

The proposed methodology allows for the construction of a prediction band for the response variable using any estimator of the regression function. The resulting prediction band preserves the consistency properties of the original estimator under standard assumptions, while guaranteeing finite-sample marginal coverage even when these assumptions do not hold. We analyze and compare, both empirically and theoretically, the two major variants of our conformal framework: full conformal inference and split conformal inference, along with a related jackknife method. These methods offer different tradeoffs between statistical accuracy (length of resulting prediction intervals) and computational efficiency. As extensions, we develop a method for constructing valid in-sample prediction intervals called rank-one-out conformal inference, which has essentially the same computational efficiency as split conformal inference. We also describe an extension of our procedures for producing prediction bands with locally varying length, to adapt to heteroscedasticity in the data. Finally, we propose a model-free notion of variable importance, called leave-one-covariate-out or LOCO inference. Accompanying this article is an R package conformalInference that implements all of the proposals we have introduced. In the spirit of reproducibility, all of our empirical results can also be easily (re)generated using this package.},

We analyze and compare the power of several recent proposals using the asymptotic framework of Li \& Barber (2015). While accumulation tests including ForwardStop can be quite powerful when the ordering is very informative, they are asymptotically powerless when the ordering is weaker. By contrast, Selective SeqStep, proposed by Barber \& Cande`s (2015), is much less sensitive to the quality of the ordering. We compare the power of these procedures in different re´gimes, concluding that Selective SeqStep dominates accumulation tests if either the ordering is weak or non-null hypotheses are sparse or weak. Motivated by our asymptotic analysis, we derive an improved version of Selective SeqStep which we call Adaptive SeqStep, analogous to Storey’s improvement on the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure. We compare these methods using the GEOQuery data set analyzed by (Li \& Barber, 2015) and find Adaptive SeqStep has favorable performance for both good and bad prior orderings.},

This catalogue of human genetic diversity contains an average of one variant every eight bases of the exome, and provides direct evidence for the presence of widespread mutational recurrence. We have used this catalogue to calculate objective metrics of pathogenicity for sequence variants, and to identify genes subject to strong selection against various classes of mutation; identifying 3,230 genes with near-complete depletion of predicted protein-truncating variants, with 72\% of these genes having no currently established human disease phenotype. Finally, we demonstrate that these data can be used for the efficient filtering of candidate disease-causing variants, and for the discovery of human ‘knockout’ variants in protein-coding genes.},

This is a critical problem for interpretability because it permits “contradictory" models to represent the same function. To solve this problem, we propose pure interaction effects: variance in the outcome which cannot be represented by any subset of features. This definition has an equivalence with the Functional ANOVA decomposition. To compute this decomposition, we present a fast, exact algorithm that transforms any piecewise-constant function (such as a tree-based model) into a purified, canonical representation.

While there is extensive literature on testing the point null hypotheses \$\textbackslash mu\_i = 0\$ with false discovery rate control, the problem of declaring whether \$\textbackslash mu\_i\$ is positive or negative with directional false discovery rate (dFDR) control has been much underserved. Leveraging the recently invented "data masking" technique, we propose a computationally efficient testing algorithm, called ZDIRECT, that seeks to mimic the optimal discovery procedure motivated by a Bayesian perspective yet provides exact dFDR control under minimal pure frequentist assumptions. In our simulation studies, ZDIRECT has demonstrated an apparent power advantage over the directional Benjamini and Hochberg procedure, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the only other existing procedure that offers dFDR control for the normal-means problem.},

We introduce a class of estimating equations that give consistent estimates of the regression parameters and of their variance under mild assumptions about the time dependence. The estimating equations are derived without specifying the joint distribution of a subject's observations yet they reduce to the score equations for multivariate Gaussian outcomes. Asymptotic theory is presented for the general class of estimators. Specific cases in which we assume independence, m-dependence and exchangeable correlation structures from each subject are discussed. Efficiency of the proposed estimators in two simple situations is considered. The approach is closely related to quasi-likelihood.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) are on course to translate the results of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) into clinical practice. To date, most GWAS have been based on individuals of European-ancestry, meaning that the utility of PRS for non-European populations is limited because SNP effects and LD patterns may not be conserved across populations. We hypothesized that cross population prediction at the level of genes rather than SNPs would be more effective, since the effect of genes on traits is likely to be more highly conserved. Therefore, we developed a framework to convert effect sizes at SNPs into effect sizes for genetically predicted transcript abundance, which we used for prediction in non-European populations. We compared this approach, which we call polygenic transcriptome risk scores (PTRS), to PRS, using data from 17 quantitative traits that were measured in multiple ancestries (European, African, East Asian, and South Asian) by UK Biobank. On average, PTRS using whole blood predicted transcriptome had lower absolute prediction accuracy than PRS, as we expected since not all regulatory processes were captured by a single tissue. However, as hypothesized, we found that in the African target set, the portability (prediction accuracy relative to the European reference set) was significantly higher for PTRS than PRS (p=0.03) with additional gain when transcriptomic prediction models ancestry matched the target population (p=0.021). Taken together, our results suggest that using PTRS can improve prediction in underrepresented populations and that increasing the diversity of transcriptomic data may be an effective way to improve portability of GWAS results between populations and help reduce health disparities.},

  abstract = {Most signals in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of complex traits point to noncoding genetic variants with putative gene regulatory effects. However, currently identified expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) explain only a small fraction of GWAS signals. By analyzing GWAS hits for complex traits in the UK Biobank, and cis-eQTLs from the GTEx consortium, we show that these assays systematically discover different types of genes and variants: eQTLs cluster strongly near transcription start sites, while GWAS hits do not. Genes near GWAS hits are enriched in numerous functional annotations, are under strong selective constraint and have a complex regulatory landscape across different tissue/cell types, while genes near eQTLs are depleted of most functional annotations, show relaxed constraint, and have simpler regulatory landscapes. We describe a model to understand these observations, including how natural selection on complex traits hinders discovery of functionally-relevant eQTLs. Our results imply that GWAS and eQTL studies are systematically biased toward different types of variants, and support the use of complementary functional approaches alongside the next generation of eQTL studies.},

Many modifications of this procedure have been proposed to improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce the ‘structure-adaptive Benjamini–Hochberg algorithm’ (SABHA) as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. The SABHA method incorporates prior information about any predetermined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that the SABHA method controls the FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the data—interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights. We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including ordered, grouped and low total variation structures, and obtain the bounds on the FDR for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of the SABHA method on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity data and on gene–drug response data, as well as on simulated data.},

These dependencies are not naturally captured by the typical Dirichlet-multinomial formulation. Here, we leverage a logistic stick-breaking representation and recent innovations in Po´lya-gamma augmentation to reformulate the multinomial distribution in terms of latent variables with jointly Gaussian likelihoods, enabling us to take advantage of a host of Bayesian inference techniques for Gaussian models with minimal overhead.},

  abstract = {Empirical risk minimization (ERM) is typically designed to perform well on the average loss, which can result in estimators that are sensitive to outliers, generalize poorly, or treat subgroups unfairly. While many methods aim to address these problems individually, in this work, we explore them through a unified framework—tilted empirical risk minimization (TERM). In particular, we show that it is possible to flexibly tune the impact of individual losses through a straightforward extension to ERM using a hyperparameter called the tilt. We provide several interpretations of the resulting framework: We show that TERM can increase or decrease the influence of outliers, respectively, to enable fairness or robustness; has variancereduction properties that can benefit generalization; and can be viewed as a smooth approximation to a superquantile method. We develop batch and stochastic firstorder optimization methods for solving TERM, and show that the problem can be efficiently solved relative to common alternatives. Finally, we demonstrate that TERM can be used for a multitude of applications, such as enforcing fairness between subgroups, mitigating the effect of outliers, and handling class imbalance. TERM is not only competitive with existing solutions tailored to these individual problems, but can also enable entirely new applications, such as simultaneously addressing outliers and promoting fairness.},

The existing set-based tests can suffer significant power loss when only a small proportion of variants are causal, and their powers can be sensitive to the number, effect sizes, and effect directions of the causal variants and the choices of weights. Here we propose an aggregated Cauchy association test (ACAT), a general, powerful, and computationally efficient p value combination method for boosting power in sequencing studies. First, by combining variant-level p values, we use ACAT to construct a set-based test (ACAT-V) that is particularly powerful in the presence of only a small number of causal variants in a variant set. Second, by combining different variant-set-level p values, we use ACAT to construct an omnibus test (ACAT-O) that combines the strength of multiple complimentary set-based tests, including the burden test, sequence kernel association test (SKAT), and ACAT-V. Through analysis of extensively simulated data and the whole-genome sequencing data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study, we demonstrate that ACAT-V complements the SKAT and the burden test, and that ACAT-O has a substantially more robust and higher power than those of the alternative tests.},

  abstract = {Combining individual p-values to aggregate multiple small effects has a long-standing interest in statistics, dating back to the classic Fisher’s combination test. In modern large-scale data analysis, correlation and sparsity are common features and efficient computation is a necessary requirement for dealing with massive data. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new test that takes advantage of the Cauchy distribution. Our test statistic has a simple form and is defined as a weighted sum of Cauchy transformation of individual p-values. We prove a nonasymptotic result that the tail of the null distribution of our proposed test statistic can be well approximated by a Cauchy distribution under arbitrary dependency structures. Based on this theoretical result, the p-value calculation of our proposed test is not only accurate, but also as simple as the classic z-test or t-test, making our test well suited for analyzing massive data. We further show that the power of the proposed test is asymptotically optimal in a strong sparsity setting. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed test has both strong power against sparse alternatives and a good accuracy with respect to p-value calculations, especially for very small p-values. The proposed test has also been applied to a genome-wide association study of Crohn’s disease and compared with several existing tests. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Profiling tumors with single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has the potential to identify recurrent patterns of transcription variation related to cancer progression, and so produce new therapeutically-relevant insights. However, the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity often obscures more subtle patterns that are shared across tumors, some of which may characterize clinically-relevant disease subtypes. Here we introduce a new statistical method to address this problem. We show that this method can help decompose transcriptional heterogeneity into interpretable components — including patient-specific, dataset-specific and shared components relevant to disease subtypes — and that, in the presence of strong inter-tumor heterogeneity, our method can produce more interpretable results than existing widely-used methods. Applied to data from three studies on pancreatic cancer adenocarcinoma (PDAC), our method produces a refined characterization of existing tumor subtypes (e.g. classical vs basal), and identifies a new gene expression program (GEP) that is prognostic of poor survival independent of established prognostic factors such as tumor stage and subtype. The new GEP is enriched for genes involved in a variety of stress responses, and suggests a potentially important role for the integrated stress response in PDAC development and prognosis.},

Although it is a fairly standard practice to test whether the odds ratios are indeed constant, there is remarkably little methodology available for proceeding when there is evidence of some heterogeneity. Our interest is in models where the log odds ratios θk, for tables k = 1, 2, …, K, are thought of as a sample from a population with mean θ and standard deviation σ, and inferences are desired regarding the parameters (θ, σ). By Mantel-Haenszel-type models we mean to include the generalization involving pairs of Poisson observations rather than 2 ×2 tables, where the θk are logarithms of ratios of the Poisson means within pairs. Direct computation of the likelihood function for (θ, σ) in these settings involves numerical integration, and the main point here is a simple approximation to this likelihood. The approximation is based on Laplace's method, and is very accurate for practical applications. Inference regarding the parameter θ of primary interest may be made from the profile likelihood function. An alternative approach to likelihood methods, based on approximations to the marginal means and variances, is also considered. The methods explored here can be readily generalized to settings where the parameters θk depend on covariables as well.},

By far the most common first step, taken by seminal papers and by core software libraries alike, is to model MNIST data using a deep network parameterizing a Bernoulli likelihood.  This practice contains what appears to be and what is often set aside as a minor inconvenience: the pixel data is [0,1] valued, not \{0,1\} as supported by the Bernoulli likelihood.  Here we show that, far from being a triviality or nuisance that is convenient to ignore, this error has profound importance to VAE, both qualitative and quantitative.  We introduce and fully characterize a new [0,1]-supported, single parameter distribution: the continuous Bernoulli, which patches this pervasive bug in VAE.  This distribution is not nitpicking; it produces meaningful performance improvements across a range of metrics and datasets, including sharper image samples, and suggests a broader class of performant VAE.},

When one hypothesis is nested inside another, the outer hypothesis must be false if the inner hypothesis is false. We model the nested structure as a directed acyclic graph, including chain and tree graphs as special cases. Each node in the graph is a hypothesis and rejecting a node requires also rejecting all of its ancestors. We propose a general framework for adjusting node-level test statistics using the known logical constraints. Within this framework, we study a smoothing procedure that combines each node with all of its descendants to form a more powerful statistic. We prove a broad class of smoothing strategies can be used with existing selection procedures to control the familywise error rate, false discovery exceedance rate, or false discovery rate, so long as the original test statistics are independent under the null. When the null statistics are not independent but are derived from positively-correlated normal observations, we prove control for all three error rates when the smoothing method is arithmetic averaging of the observations. Simulations and an application to a real biology dataset demonstrate that smoothing leads to substantial power gains.},

Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

We show that the log-transformation can introduce systematic errors when cells vary in sequencing coverage, leading to spurious non-zero differences in expression and artificial population structure in simulations. We observe similar effects in real scRNA-seq data where the difference in transformed values between groups of cells is not an accurate proxy for the log-fold change. We provide some practical recommendations to overcome this effect and analytically derive an expression for a larger pseudo-count that controls the transformation-induced error to a specified threshold.},

However, researchers still face several challenges when using GO and other functional annotation databases. One problem is the large number of multiple hypotheses that are being tested for each study. In addition, categories often overlap with both direct parents/descendents and other distant categories in the hierarchical structure. This makes it hard to determine if the identified significant categories represent different functional outcomes or rather a redundant view of the same biological processes. To overcome these problems we developed a generative probabilistic model which identifies a (small) subset of categories that, together, explain the selected gene set. Our model accommodates noise and errors in the selected gene set and GO. Using controlled GO data our method correctly recovered most of the selected categories, leading to dramatic improvements over current methods for GO analysis. When used with microarray expression data and ChIP-chip data from yeast and human our method was able to correctly identify both general and specific enriched categories which were overlooked by other methods.},

One implication is that likelihood theory lacks the generality of e.g. Bayesian inference, wherein marginalization is the universal tool for dealing with nuisance parameters. Here we argue that profile likelihood has as much claim to being a true likelihood as a marginal probability has to being a true probability distribution. The crucial point we argue is that a likelihood function is naturally interpreted as a maxitive possibility measure: given this, the associated theory of integration with respect to maxitive measures delivers profile likelihood as the direct analogue of marginal probability in additive measure theory. Thus, given a background likelihood function, we argue that profiling over the likelihood function is as natural (or as unnatural, as the case may be) as marginalizing over a background probability measure. The connections to Bayesian inference can also be further clarified with the introduction of a suitable logarithmic distance function, in which case the present theory can be naturally described as 'Tropical Bayes' in the sense of tropical algebra.},

Here, we develop an integrative and scalable computational method, iDEA, to perform joint DE and GSE analysis through a hierarchical Bayesian framework. By integrating DE and GSE analyses, iDEA can improve the power and consistency of DE analysis and the accuracy of GSE analysis. Importantly, iDEA uses only DE summary statistics as input, enabling effective data modeling through complementing and pairing with various existing DE methods. We illustrate the benefits of iDEA with extensive simulations. We also apply iDEA to analyze three scRNA-seq data sets, where iDEA achieves up to five-fold power gain over existing GSE methods and up to 64\% power gain over existing DE methods. The power gain brought by iDEA allows us to identify many pathways that would not be identified by existing approaches in these data.},

  abstract = {Genetic predisposition for complex traits often acts through multiple tissues at different time points during development. As a simple example, the genetic predisposition for obesity could be manifested either through inherited variants that control metabolism through regulation of genes expressed in the brain, or that control fat storage through dysregulation of genes expressed in adipose tissue, or both. Here we describe a statistical approach that leverages tissue-specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) corresponding to tissue-specific genes to prioritize a relevant tissue underlying the genetic predisposition of a given individual for a complex trait. Unlike existing approaches that prioritize relevant tissues for the trait in the population, our approach probabilistically quantifies the tissue-wise genetic contribution to the trait for a given individual. We hypothesize that for a subgroup of individuals the genetic contribution to the trait can be mediated primarily through a specific tissue. Through simulations using the UK Biobank, we show that our approach can predict the relevant tissue accurately and can cluster individuals according to their tissue-specific genetic architecture. We analyze body mass index (BMI) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI) in the UK Biobank to identify subgroups of individuals whose genetic predisposition act primarily through brain versus adipose tissue, and adipose versus muscle tissue, respectively. Notably, we find that these individuals have specific phenotypic features beyond BMI and WHRadjBMI that distinguish them from random individuals in the data, suggesting biological effects of tissue-specific genetic contribution for these traits.},

In this work, we show that linkage disequilibrium (LD) among SNPs induce significant gene-trait associations at non-causal genes as a function of the overlap between eQTL weights used in expression prediction. We introduce a probabilistic framework that models the induced correlation among TWAS signals to assign a probability for every gene in the risk region to explain the observed association signal. Our approach yields credible sets of genes containing the causal gene at a nominal confidence level (e.g., 90\%) that can be used to prioritize and select genes for functional assays. Importantly, our approach remains accurate when expression data for causal genes are not available in the casual tissue by leveraging expression prediction from other tissues. We illustrate our approach using an integrative analysis of lipids traits where we correctly identify known causal genes.},

By contrast, machine learning-based classification algorithms have superior performances on modern datasets but typically fall short of error-controlling guarantees. In this paper, we make these two meet by introducing a new adaptive novelty detection procedure with FDR control, called AdaDetect. It extends the scope of recent works of multiple testing literature to the high dimensional setting, notably the one in Yang et al. (2021). We prove that AdaDetect comes with finite sample guarantees: it controls the FDR strongly and approximates the oracle in terms of the power, with explicit remainder terms that are small under mild conditions. In practice, AdaDetect can be used in combination with any machine learning-based classifier, which allows the user to choose the most relevant classification approach. We illustrate this with classical real-world datasets, for which random forest and neural network classifiers are particularly efficient. The versatility of our method is also shown with an astrophysical application.},

  abstract = {Spatial population genetic data often exhibits ‘isolation-by-distance,’ where genetic similarity tends to decrease as individuals become more geographically distant. The rate at which genetic similarity decays with distance is often spatially heterogeneous due to variable population processes like genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection. Petkova et al., 2016 developed a statistical method called Estimating Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) for visualizing spatially heterogeneous isolation-by-distance on a geographic map. While EEMS is a powerful tool for depicting spatial population structure, it can suffer from slow runtimes. Here, we develop a related method called Fast Estimation of Effective Migration Surfaces (FEEMS). FEEMS uses a Gaussian Markov Random Field model in a penalized likelihood framework that allows for efficient optimization and output of effective migration surfaces. Further, the efficient optimization facilitates the inference of migration parameters per edge in the graph, rather than per node (as in EEMS). With simulations, we show conditions under which FEEMS can accurately recover effective migration surfaces with complex gene-flow histories, including those with anisotropy. We apply FEEMS to population genetic data from North American gray wolves and show it performs favorably in comparison to EEMS, with solutions obtained orders of magnitude faster. Overall, FEEMS expands the ability of users to quickly visualize and interpret spatial structure in their data.},

However, the reported variants tend to explain small fractions of risk, and there are doubts about issues such as the portability of findings over different ethnic groups or the relative roles of rare versus common variants in the genetic architecture of complex disease. Studying the degree of sharing of disease-associated variants across populations can help in solving these issues. We present a comprehensive survey of GWAS replicability across 28 diseases. Most loci and SNPs discovered in Europeans for these conditions have been extensively replicated using peoples of European and East Asian ancestry, while the replication with individuals of African ancestry is much less common. We found a strong and significant correlation of Odds Ratios across Europeans and East Asians, indicating that underlying causal variants are common and shared between the two ancestries. Moreover, SNPs that failed to replicate in East Asians map into genomic regions where Linkage Disequilibrium patterns differ significantly between populations. Finally, we observed that GWAS with larger sample sizes have detected variants with weaker effects rather than with lower frequencies. Our results indicate that most GWAS results are due to common variants. In addition, the sharing of disease alleles and the high correlation in their effect sizes suggest that most of the underlying causal variants are shared between Europeans and East Asians and that they tend to map close to the associated marker SNPs.},

  abstract = {This is a short description and basic introduction to the Integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) approach. INLA is a deterministic paradigm for Bayesian inference in latent Gaussian models (LGMs) introduced in Rue et al. (2009). INLA relies on a combination of analytical approximations and efficient numerical integration schemes to achieve highly accurate deterministic approximations to posterior quantities of interest. The main benefit of using INLA instead of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for LGMs is computational; INLA is fast even for large, complex models. Moreover, being a deterministic algorithm, INLA does not suffer from slow convergence and poor mixing. INLA is implemented in the R package R-INLA, which represents a user-friendly and versatile tool for doing Bayesian inference. R-INLA returns posterior marginals for all model parameters and the corresponding posterior summary information. Model choice criteria as well as predictive diagnostics are directly available. Here, we outline the theory behind INLA, present the R-INLA package and describe new developments of combining INLA with MCMC for models that are not possible to fit with R-INLA.},

  abstract = {Genetics provides two major opportunities for understanding human disease—as a transformative line of etiological inquiry and as a biomarker for heritable diseases. In psychiatry, biomarkers are very much needed for both research and treatment, given the heterogenous populations identified by current phenomenologically based diagnostic systems. To date, however, useful and valid biomarkers have been scant owing to the inaccessibility and complexity of human brain tissue and consequent lack of insight into disease mechanisms. Genetic biomarkers are therefore especially promising for psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies of common diseases have matured over the last decade, generating the knowledge base for increasingly informative individual-level genetic risk prediction. In this review, we discuss fundamental concepts involved in computing genetic risk with current methods, strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, assessments of utility, and applications to various psychiatric disorders and related traits. Although genetic risk prediction has become increasingly straightforward to apply and common in published studies, there are important pitfalls to avoid. At present, the clinical utility of genetic risk prediction is still low; however, there is significant promise for future clinical applications as the ancestral diversity and sample sizes of genome-wide association studies increase. We discuss emerging data and methods aimed at improving the value of genetic risk prediction for disentangling disease mechanisms and stratifying subjects for epidemiological and clinical studies. For all applications, it is absolutely critical that polygenic risk prediction is applied with appropriate methodology and control for confounding to avoid repeating some mistakes of the candidate gene era.},

So rare variants association studies hold promise for understanding disease. Conversely though, the rareness of the variants poses practical challenges; since these variants are present in few individuals, it can be difficult to develop data-collection and statistical methods that effectively leverage their sparse information. In this work, we develop a novel Bayesian nonparametric model to capture how design choices in rare variants association studies can impact their usefulness. We then show how to use our model to guide design choices under a fixed experimental budget in practice. In particular, we provide a practical workflow and illustrative experiments on simulated data.},

We show that these variants are concentrated in regulatory DNA marked by DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). 88\% of such DHSs are active during fetal development, and are enriched for gestational exposure-related phenotypes. We identify distant gene targets for hundreds of DHSs that may explain phenotype associations. Disease-associated variants systematically perturb transcription factor recognition sequences, frequently alter allelic chromatin states, and form regulatory networks. We also demonstrate tissue-selective enrichment of more weakly disease-associated variants within DHSs, and the de novo identification of pathogenic cell types for Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and an electrocardiogram trait, without prior knowledge of physiological mechanisms. Our results suggest pervasive involvement of regulatory DNA variation in common human disease, and provide pathogenic insights into diverse disorders.},

Here we present a novel machine learning method called REGENIE for fitting a whole genome regression model that is orders of magnitude faster than alternatives, while maintaining statistical efficiency. The method naturally accommodates parallel analysis of multiple phenotypes, and only requires local segments of the genotype matrix to be loaded in memory, in contrast to existing alternatives which must load genomewide matrices into memory. This results in substantial savings in compute time and memory usage. The method is applicable to both quantitative and binary phenotypes, including rare variant analysis of binary traits with unbalanced case-control ratios where we introduce a fast, approximate Firth logistic regression test. The method is ideally suited to take advantage of distributed computing frameworks. We demonstrate the accuracy and computational benefits of this approach compared to several existing methods using quantitative and binary traits from the UK Biobank dataset with up to 407,746 individuals.},

No random sampling of units is involved. In biological work, random sampling is frequently unavoidable, in which case the joint distribution p.y, x/ depends on the sampling scheme. Regression models can be used for the study of dependence provided that the conditional distribution p.yjx/ for random samples agrees with px.y/ as determined by the regression model for a fixed sample having a non-random configuration x. The paper develops a model that avoids the concept of a fixed population of units, thereby forcing the sampling plan to be incorporated into the sampling distribution. For a quota sample having a predetermined covariate configuration x, the sampling distribution agrees with the standard logistic regression model with correlated components. For most natural sampling plans such as sequential or simple random sampling, the conditional distribution p.yjx/ is not the same as the regression distribution unless px.y/ has independent components. In this sense, most natural sampling schemes involving binary random-effects models are biased.The implications of this formulation for subject-specific and population-averaged procedures are explored.},

  abstract = {Despite growing interest in the effects of landscape heterogeneity on genetic structuring, few tools are available to incorporate data on landscape composition into population genetic studies. Analyses of isolation by distance have typically either assumed spatial homogeneity for convenience or applied theoretically unjustified distance metrics to compensate for heterogeneity. Here I propose the isolation-by-resistance (IBR) model as an alternative for predicting equilibrium genetic structuring in complex landscapes. The model predicts a positive relationship between genetic differentiation and the resistance distance, a distance metric that exploits precise relationships between random walk times and effective resistances in electronic networks. As a predictor of genetic differentiation, the resistance distance is both more theoretically justified and more robust to spatial heterogeneity than Euclidean or least cost path-based distance measures. Moreover, the metric can be applied with a wide range of data inputs, including coarse-scale range maps, simple maps of habitat and nonhabitat within a species' range, or complex spatial datasets with habitats and barriers of differing qualities. The IBR model thus provides a flexible and efficient tool to account for habitat heterogeneity in studies of isolation by distance, improve understanding of how landscape characteristics affect genetic structuring, and predict genetic and evolutionary consequences of landscape change.},

Taking those relationships into account, however, can lead to more powerful variants of existing multiple testing procedures and can make summarizing and interpreting the final results easier. We will show that, from the perspective of interpretation as well as from the perspective of power improvement, FWER controlling methods are more suitable than FDR controlling methods.

Neighborhood selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs. Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining some distinct connectivity components of the graph, consistent estimation for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when the number of variables grows as the number of observations raised to an arbitrary power.},

Agents wish to benefit from the collective expertise of the full set of agents to make better predictions than they would individually, but may not be willing to release labeled data or model parameters. In this work, we explore a decentralized mechanism to make collective predictions at test time, that is inspired by the literature in social science on human consensus-making. Building on a query model to facilitate information exchange among agents, our approach leverages each agent’s pre-trained model without relying on external validation, model retraining, or data pooling. A theoretical analysis shows that our approach recovers inverse mean-squared-error (MSE) weighting in the large-sample limit which is known to be the optimal way to combine independent, unbiased estimators. Empirically, we demonstrate that our scheme effectively combines models with differing quality across the input space: the proposed consensus prediction achieves significant gains over classical model averaging, and even outperforms weighted averaging schemes that have access to additional validation data. Finally, we propose a decentralized Jackknife procedure as a tool to evaluate the sensitivity of the collective predictions with respect to a single agent's opinion.},

Since the probabilistic CGF is minimized in terms of the R\textbackslash 'enyi entropy of the source, one of the motivations of this study is to derive an individual-sequence analogue of the R\textbackslash 'enyi entropy, in the same way that the FS compressibility is the individual-sequence counterpart of the Shannon entropy. We consider the CGF of the code-length both from the perspective of fixed-to-variable (F-V) length coding and the perspective of variable-to-variable (V-V) length coding, where the latter turns out to yield a better result, that coincides with the FS compressibility. We also extend our results to compression with side information, available at both the encoder and decoder. In this case, the V-V version no longer coincides with the FS compressibility, but results in a different complexity measure.},

We created high-resolution maps of DHSs from 733 human biosamples encompassing 438 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to delineate and numerically index approximately 3.6 million DHSs within the human genome sequence, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that these maps highly resolve the cis-regulatory compartment of the human genome, which encodes unexpectedly diverse cell- and tissue-selective regulatory programs at very high density. These programs can be captured comprehensively by a simple vocabulary that enables the assignment to each DHS of a regulatory barcode that encapsulates its tissue manifestations, and global annotation of protein-coding and non-coding RNA genes in a manner orthogonal to gene expression. Finally, we show that sharply resolved DHSs markedly enhance the genetic association and heritability signals of diseases and traits. Rather than being confined to a small number of distal elements or promoters, we find that genetic signals converge on congruently regulated sets of DHSs that decorate entire gene bodies. Together, our results create a universal, extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA marked by DHSs, and provide a new global perspective on the architecture of human gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) calculated from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Europeans are known to have substantially reduced predictive accuracy in non-European populations, limiting their clinical utility and raising concerns about health disparities across ancestral populations. Here, we introduce a statistical framework named X-Wing to improve predictive performance in ancestrally diverse populations. X-Wing quantifies local genetic correlations for complex traits between populations, employs an annotation-dependent estimation procedure to amplify correlated genetic effects between populations, and combines multiple population-specific PRS into a unified score with GWAS summary statistics alone as input. Through extensive benchmarking, we demonstrate that X-Wing pinpoints portable genetic effects and substantially improves PRS performance in non-European populations, showing 14.1\%–119.1\% relative gain in predictive R2 compared to state-of-the-art methods based on GWAS summary statistics. Overall, X-Wing addresses critical limitations in existing approaches and may have broad applications in cross-population polygenic risk prediction.},

  abstract = {When assessing differential gene expression from RNA sequencing data, commonly used statistical tests tend to have greater power to detect differential expression of genes encoding longer transcripts. This phenomenon, called “length bias”, will influence subsequent analyses such as Gene Ontology enrichment analysis. In the presence of length bias, Gene Ontology categories that include longer genes are more likely to be identified as enriched. These categories, however, are not necessarily biologically more relevant. We show that one can effectively adjust for length bias in Gene Ontology analysis by including transcript length as a covariate in a logistic regression model. The logistic regression model makes the statistical issue underlying length bias more transparent: transcript length becomes a confounding factor when it correlates with both the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of the differential expression test. The inclusion of the transcript length as a covariate allows one to investigate the direct correlation between the Gene Ontology membership and the significance of testing differential expression, conditional on the transcript length. We present both real and simulated data examples to show that the logistic regression approach is simple, effective, and flexible.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, “Expectation Propagation,” unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace’s method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

The families and subfamilies are annotated with Gene Ontology terms and sequences are assigned to PANTHER pathways. A suite of tools has been built to allow users to browse and query gene functions, and analyze large-scale experimental data with a number of statistical tests. PANTHER is widely used by bench scientists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and systems biologists. Since the protocol to use this tool (v8.0) was originally published in 2013, there have been significant improvements and updates in the areas of data quality, data coverage, statistical algorithms and user experience.

These better represent a wider range of biological processes and diseases, but the utility of the database is reduced by increased redundancy across, and heterogeneity within, gene sets. To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.},

  abstract = {The genetic basis of most complex traits is highly polygenic and dominated by non-coding alleles. It is widely assumed that such alleles exert small regulatory effects on the expression of             cis             -linked genes. However, despite the availability of expansive gene expression and epigenomic data sets, few variant-to-gene links have emerged. We identified 134 gene-trait pairs in which protein-coding variants cause severe or familial forms of nine human traits. For most of these genes, we find that adjacent non-coding variation is associated with common complex forms of the same traits. However, we found limited evidence of colocalization—the same variant influencing both the physiological trait and gene expression—for only 7\% of genes, and transcriptome-wide association evidence with correct direction of effect for only 6\% of genes, despite the presence of eQTLs in most loci. Fine-mapping variants to regulatory elements and assigning these to genes by linear distance similarly failed to implicate most genes in complex traits. These results contradict the hypothesis that most complex trait-associated variants coincide with currently ascertained expression quantitative trait loci. The field must confront this deficit, and pursue this “missing regulation.”},

In this study, cytosine modification levels in 133 HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from individuals of European or African ancestry were profiled using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. Approximately 13\% of the analyzed CpG sites showed differential modification between the two populations at a false discovery rate of 1\%. The CpG sites with greater modification levels in European descent were enriched in the proximal regulatory regions, while those greater in African descent were biased toward gene bodies. More than half of the detected population-specific cytosine modifications could be explained primarily by local genetic variation. In addition, a substantial proportion of local modification quantitative trait loci exhibited population-specific effects, suggesting that genetic epistasis and/or genotype × environment interactions could be common. Distinct correlations were observed between gene expression levels and cytosine modifications in proximal regions and gene bodies, suggesting epigenetic regulation of interindividual expression variation. Furthermore, quantitative trait loci associated with population-specific modifications can be colocalized with expression quantitative trait loci and single nucleotide polymorphisms previously identified for complex traits with known racial disparities. Our findings revealed abundant population-specific cytosine modifications and the underlying genetic basis, as well as the relatively independent contribution of genetic and epigenetic variations to population differences in gene expression.},

We observed that GFI1B transtarget genes were enriched for GFI1B binding sites and fine-mapped GWAS variants, and expressed in human bone marrow progenitor cells, suggesting that GFI1B acts as a master regulator of blood traits.

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many variants associated with complex traits, but identifying the causal gene(s) is a major challenge. In the present study, we present an open resource that provides systematic fine mapping and gene prioritization across 133,441 published human GWAS loci. We integrate genetics (GWAS Catalog and UK Biobank) with transcriptomic, proteomic and epigenomic data, including systematic disease–disease and disease–molecular trait colocalization results across 92 cell types and tissues. We identify 729 loci fine mapped to a single-coding causal variant and colocalized with a single gene. We trained a machine-learning model using the fine-mapped genetics and functional genomics data and 445 gold-standard curated GWAS loci to distinguish causal genes from neighboring genes, outperforming a naive distance-based model. Our prioritized genes were enriched for known approved drug targets (odds ratio\,=\,8.1, 95\% confidence interval\,=\,5.7, 11.5). These results are publicly available through a web portal (http://genetics.opentargets.org), enabling users to easily prioritize genes at disease-associated loci and assess their potential as drug targets.},

  abstract = {Gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions determine common disease risk factors and biomedically relevant complex traits. However, quantifying how the environment modulates genetic effects on human quantitative phenotypes presents unique challenges. Environmental covariates are complex and difficult to measure and control at the organismal level, as found in GWAS and epidemiological studies. An alternative approach focuses on the cellular environment using in vitro treatments as a proxy for the organismal environment. These cellular environments simplify the organism-level environmental exposures to provide a tractable influence on subcellular phenotypes, such as gene expression. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping studies identified GxE interactions in response to drug treatment and pathogen exposure. However, eQTL mapping approaches are infeasible for large-scale analysis of multiple cellular environments. Recently, allele-specific expression (ASE) analysis emerged as a powerful tool to identify GxE interactions in gene expression patterns by exploiting naturally occurring environmental exposures. Here we characterized genetic effects on the transcriptional response to 50 treatments in five cell types. We discovered 1455 genes with ASE (FDR {$<$} 10\%) and 215 genes with GxE interactions. We demonstrated a major role for GxE interactions in complex traits. Genes with a transcriptional response to environmental perturbations showed sevenfold higher odds of being found in GWAS. Additionally, 105 genes that indicated GxE interactions (49\%) were identified by GWAS as associated with complex traits. Examples include               GIPR               –caffeine interaction and obesity and include               LAMP3               –selenium interaction and Parkinson disease. Our results demonstrate that comprehensive catalogs of GxE interactions are indispensable to thoroughly annotate genes and bridge epidemiological and genome-wide association studies.},

  abstract = {Pathway-centric approaches are widely used to interpret and contextualize -omics data. However, databases contain different representations of the same biological pathway, which may lead to different results of statistical enrichment analysis and predictive models in the context of precision medicine. We have performed an in-depth benchmarking of the impact of pathway database choice on statistical enrichment analysis and predictive modeling. We analyzed five cancer datasets using three major pathway databases and developed an approach to merge several databases into a single integrative one: MPath. Our results show that equivalent pathways from different databases yield disparate results in statistical enrichment analysis. Moreover, we observed a significant dataset-dependent impact on the performance of machine learning models on different prediction tasks. In some cases, MPath significantly improved prediction performance and also reduced the variance of prediction performances. Furthermore, MPath yielded more consistent and biologically plausible results in statistical enrichment analyses. In summary, this benchmarking study demonstrates that pathway database choice can influence the results of statistical enrichment analysis and predictive modeling. Therefore, we recommend the use of multiple pathway databases or integrative ones.},

  abstract = {Background Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide, and nonfatal suicide attempts, which occur far more frequently, are a major source of disability and social and economic burden. Both have substantial genetic etiology, which is partially shared and partially distinct from that of related psychiatric disorders. Methods We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 29,782 suicide attempt (SA) cases and 519,961 controls in the International Suicide Genetics Consortium (ISGC). The GWAS of SA was conditioned on psychiatric disorders using GWAS summary statistics via multitrait-based conditional and joint analysis, to remove genetic effects on SA mediated by psychiatric disorders. We investigated the shared and divergent genetic architectures of SA, psychiatric disorders, and other known risk factors. Results Two loci reached genome-wide significance for SA: the major histocompatibility complex and an intergenic locus on chromosome 7, the latter of which remained associated with SA after conditioning on psychiatric disorders and replicated in an independent cohort from the Million Veteran Program. This locus has been implicated in risk-taking behavior, smoking, and insomnia. SA showed strong genetic correlation with psychiatric disorders, particularly major depression, and also with smoking, pain, risk-taking behavior, sleep disturbances, lower educational attainment, reproductive traits, lower socioeconomic status, and poorer general health. After conditioning on psychiatric disorders, the genetic correlations between SA and psychiatric disorders decreased, whereas those with nonpsychiatric traits remained largely unchanged. Conclusions Our results identify a risk locus that contributes more strongly to SA than other phenotypes and suggest a shared underlying biology between SA and known risk factors that is not mediated by psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Exploration of genetic variant-to-gene relationships by quantitative trait loci such as expression QTLs is a frequently used tool in genome-wide association studies. However, the wide range of public QTL databases and the lack of batch annotation features complicate a comprehensive annotation of GWAS results. In this work, we introduce the tool “Qtlizer” for annotating lists of variants in human with associated changes in gene expression and protein abundance using an integrated database of published QTLs. Features include incorporation of variants in linkage disequilibrium and reverse search by gene names. Analyzing the database for base pair distances between best significant eQTLs and their affected genes suggests that the commonly used cis-distance limit of 1,000,000 base pairs might be too restrictive, implicating a substantial amount of wrongly and yet undetected eQTLs. We also ranked genes with respect to the maximum number of tissue-specific eQTL studies in which a most significant eQTL signal was consistent. For the top 100 genes we observed the strongest enrichment with housekeeping genes (P\,=\,2\,×\,10–6) and with the 10\% highest expressed genes (P\,=\,0.005) after grouping eQTLs by r2\,{$>$}\,0.95, underlining the relevance of LD information in eQTL analyses.

Recently, convolutional neural networks have been used to learn predictive cis-regulatory DNA sequence models of context-specific chromatin accessibility landscapes. However, these context-specific regulatory sequence models cannot generalize predictions across cell types.We introduce multi-modal, residual neural network architectures that integrate cis-regulatory sequence and context-specific expression of trans-regulators to predict genome-wide chromatin accessibility profiles across cellular contexts. We show that the average accessibility of a genomic region across training contexts can be a surprisingly powerful predictor. We leverage this feature and employ novel strategies for training models to enhance genome-wide prediction of shared and context-specific chromatin accessible sites across cell types. We interpret the models to reveal insights into cis- and trans-regulation of chromatin dynamics across 123 diverse cellular contexts.The code is available at https://github.com/kundajelab/ChromDragoNN.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional regulation displays extensive robustness, but human genetics indicate sensitivity to transcription factor (TF) dosage. Reconciling such observations requires quantitative studies of TF dosage effects at trait-relevant ranges, which are lacking to date. TFs play central roles in both normal-range and disease-associated variation in facial morphology; we therefore developed an approach to precisely modulate TF levels in human facial progenitors and applied it to SOX9, a TF associated with craniofacial variation and disease (Pierre Robin Sequence, PRS). We found that most SOX9-dependent regulatory elements (REs) are buffered against small decreases in SOX9 dosage, but REs directly and primarily regulated by SOX9 show heightened sensitivity to SOX9 dosage; these RE responses predict gene expression responses. Sensitive REs and genes underlie the vulnerability of chondrogenesis and PRS-like craniofacial shape variation to SOX9 dosage perturbation. We propose that such REs and genes drive the sensitivity of specific phenotypes to TF dosage, while buffering of other genes leads to robust, nonlinear dosage-to-phenotype relationships.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of noncoding loci that are associated with human diseases and complex traits, each of which could reveal insights into the mechanisms of disease1. Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer–gene~maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.},

  abstract = {Non-coding genetic variants may cause disease by modulating gene expression. However, identifying these expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) is complicated by differences in gene regulation across fluid functional cell states within cell types. These states—for example, neurotransmitter-driven programs in astrocytes or perivascular fibroblast differentiation—are obscured in eQTL studies that aggregate cells1,2. Here we modelled eQTLs at single-cell resolution in one complex cell type: memory T cells. Using more than 500,000 unstimulated memory T cells from 259 Peruvian individuals, we show that around one-third of 6,511 cis-eQTLs had effects that were mediated by continuous multimodally defined cell states, such as cytotoxicity and regulatory capacity. In some loci, independent eQTL variants had opposing cell-state relationships. Autoimmune variants were enriched in cell-state-dependent eQTLs, including risk variants for rheumatoid arthritis near ORMDL3 and CTLA4; this indicates that cell-state context is crucial to understanding potential eQTL pathogenicity. Moreover, continuous cell states explained more variation in eQTLs than did conventional discrete categories, such as CD4+ versus CD8+, suggesting that modelling eQTLs and cell states at single-cell resolution can expand insight into gene regulation in functionally heterogeneous cell types.},

They then test each gene for association with the estimated latent variable. If the same data are used for both of these steps, then standard methods for computing p-values and confidence intervals in the second step will fail to achieve statistical guarantees such as Type 1 error control. Furthermore, approaches such as sample splitting that can be applied to solve similar problems in other settings are not applicable in this context. In this paper, we introduce count splitting, a flexible framework that allows us to carry out valid inference in this setting, for virtually any latent variable estimation technique and inference approach, under a Poisson assumption. We demonstrate the Type 1 error control and power of count splitting in a simulation study, and apply count splitting to a dataset of pluripotent stem cells differentiating to cardiomyocytes.},

  abstract = {A prespecified set of genes may be enriched, to varying degrees, for genes that have altered expression levels relative to two or more states of a cell. Knowing the enrichment of gene sets defined by functional categories, such as gene ontology (GO) annotations, is valuable for analyzing the biological signals in microarray expression data. A common approach to measuring enrichment is by cross-classifying genes according to membership in a functional category and membership on a selected list of significantly altered genes. A small Fisher's exact test \$p\$-value, for example, in this \$2\textbackslash times2\$ table is indicative of enrichment. Other category analysis methods retain the quantitative gene-level scores and measure significance by referring a category-level statistic to a permutation distribution associated with the original differential expression problem. We describe a class of random-set scoring methods that measure distinct components of the enrichment signal. The class includes Fisher's test based on selected genes and also tests that average gene-level evidence across the category. Averaging and selection methods are compared empirically using Affymetrix data on expression in nasopharyngeal cancer tissue, and theoretically using a location model of differential expression. We find that each method has a domain of superiority in the state space of enrichment problems, and that both methods have benefits in practice. Our analysis also addresses two problems related to multiple-category inference, namely, that equally enriched categories are not detected with equal probability if they are of different sizes, and also that there is dependence among category statistics owing to shared genes. Random-set enrichment calculations do not require Monte Carlo for implementation. They are made available in the R package allez.},

  abstract = {Gene clustering and sample clustering are commonly used to find patterns in gene expression datasets. However, genes may cluster differently in heterogeneous samples (e.g. different tissues or disease states), whilst traditional methods assume that clusters are consistent across samples. Biclustering algorithms aim to solve this issue by performing sample clustering and gene clustering simultaneously. Existing reviews of biclustering algorithms have yet to include a number of more recent algorithms and have based comparisons on simplistic simulated datasets without specific evaluation of biclusters in real datasets, using less robust metrics.We compared four classes of sparse biclustering algorithms on a range of simulated and real datasets. All algorithms generally struggled on simulated datasets with a large number of genes or implanted biclusters. We found that Bayesian algorithms with strict sparsity constraints had high accuracy on the simulated datasets and did not require any post-processing, but were considerably slower than other algorithm classes. We found that non-negative matrix factorisation algorithms performed poorly, but could be re-purposed for biclustering through a sparsity-inducing post-processing procedure we introduce; one such algorithm was one of the most highly ranked on real datasets. In a multi-tissue knockout mouse RNA-seq dataset, the algorithms rarely returned clusters containing samples from multiple different tissues, whilst such clusters were identified in a human dataset of more closely related cell types (sorted blood cell subsets). This highlights the need for further thought in the design and analysis of multi-tissue studies to avoid differences between tissues dominating the analysis.Code to run the analysis is available at https://github.com/nichollskc/biclust\_comp, including wrappers for each algorithm, implementations of evaluation metrics, and code to simulate datasets and perform pre- and post-processing.

Using a web site we developed to serve results of expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies in lymphoblastoid cell lines from HapMap samples (http://www.scandb.org), we show that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with complex traits (from http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/) are significantly more likely to be eQTLs than minor-allele-frequency–matched SNPs chosen from high-throughput GWAS platforms. These findings are robust across a range of thresholds for establishing eQTLs (p-values from 10−4–10−8), and a broad spectrum of human complex traits. Analyses of GWAS data from the Wellcome Trust studies confirm that annotating SNPs with a score reflecting the strength of the evidence that the SNP is an eQTL can improve the ability to discover true associations and clarify the nature of the mechanism driving the associations. Our results showing that trait-associated SNPs are more likely to be eQTLs and that application of this information can enhance discovery of trait-associated SNPs for complex phenotypes raise the possibility that we can utilize this information both to increase the heritability explained by identifiable genetic factors and to gain a better understanding of the biology underlying complex traits.},

  abstract = {Purifying selection can substantially alter patterns of molecular evolution. Its main effect is to reduce overall levels of genetic variation, leading to a reduced effective population size. However, it also distorts genealogies relative to neutral expectations. A structured coalescent method has been used to describe this effect, and forms the basis for numerical methods and simulations. In this study, we extend this approach by making the additional approximation that lineages may be treated independently, which is valid only in the strong selection regime. We show that in this regime, the distortions due to purifying selection can be described by a time-dependent effective population size and mutation rate, confirming earlier intuition. We calculate simple analytical expressions for these functions, Ne(t) and Ue(t). These results allow us to describe the structure of genealogies in a population under strong purifying selection as equivalent to a purely neutral population with varying population size and mutation rate, thereby enabling the use of neutral methods of inference and estimation for populations in the strong selection regime.},

By fully accounting for LD across the genome, we develop a high-definition likelihood (HDL) method to improve precision in genetic correlation estimation. Compared to LDSC, HDL reduces the variance of genetic correlation estimates by about 60\%, equivalent to a 2.5-fold increase in sample size. We apply HDL and LDSC to estimate 435 genetic correlations among 30 behavioral and disease-related phenotypes measured in the UK Biobank (UKBB). In addition to 154 significant genetic correlations observed for both methods, HDL identified another 57 significant genetic correlations, compared to only another 2 significant genetic correlations identified by LDSC. HDL brings more power to genomic analyses and better reveals the underlying connections across human complex traits.},

  abstract = {Background: More highly educated parents tend to raise children who go on to complete more education themselves. Strong evidence for environmental transmission arises from the fact that offspring outcomes correlate to parental genotypes even when controlling for the offspring genotype. The process that gives rise to an environmentally mediated correlation between parental genotype and offspring education (“indirect genetic effects”) remains poorly understood. A key question is whether intergenerational transmission reflects within-family processes, such as parenting behaviors (i.e. “Genetic nurture”), or social inheritance that could reflect either genetic ancestry or social stratification (i.e. “Dynastic effects”).  Methods: We analyzed data from N = 25,215 genotyped parent-offspring trios participating in the Norwegian Mother, Father, and Child Cohort Study (MoBa), where many of the participants in the parental generation are siblings (N = 3,500 sibling pairs). We correlate genetic differences within the parental family, conditional on offspring genetics to offspring’s educational outcomes. The strategy isolates indirect genetic effects that play out in the nuclear family from indirect genetic effects that arise through social or ancestral genetic stratification. We additionally partition genetic variants associated with EA into those associated with cognitive versus non-cognitive skills.  Results: We find that children’s genetics, measured using polygenic indices (PGIs) for cognitive and non-cognitive components of EA, are associated with their educational performance. Parents’ genetics are also associated with their children’s educational performance, over and above the child’s own genetics. However, we find no evidence that parents’ PGI are specifically related to offspring academic achievement over and above the average PGI of the siblings in the parental generation.  Conclusions: Our result suggests that the effects of the environmental processes captured by genome-wide association studies of EA and characterized as “nurture” are explained less by parents’ specific behaviors and more by dynastic stratification in environments relevant to success in school.},

However, to date, there have been no studies that have mapped genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) specifically in the human prenatal brain. Results: We performed deep RNA sequencing and genome-wide genotyping on a unique collection of 120 human brains from the second trimester of gestation to provide the first eQTL dataset derived exclusively from the human fetal brain. We identify high confidence cis-acting eQTL at the individual transcript as well as whole gene level, including many mapping to a common inversion polymorphism on chromosome 17q21. Fetal brain eQTL are enriched among risk variants for postnatal conditions including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. We further identify changes in gene expression within the prenatal brain that potentially mediate risk for neuropsychiatric traits, including increased expression of C4A in association with genetic risk for schizophrenia, increased expression of LRRC57 in association with genetic risk for bipolar disorder, and altered expression of multiple genes within the chromosome 17q21 inversion in association with variants influencing the personality trait of neuroticism. Conclusions: We have mapped eQTL operating in the human fetal brain, providing evidence that these confer risk to certain neuropsychiatric disorders, and identifying gene expression changes that potentially mediate susceptibility to these conditions.},

Applied to summary statistics for ten diseases (average \$\$N\_\{\textbackslash textrm\{eff\}\} = 169,000\$\$), FMR estimates that 100,000–1,000,000 cases will be required for genome-wide significant SNPs to explain 50\% of SNP heritability. In such large studies, genome-wide significance becomes increasingly conservative, and less stringent thresholds achieve high true positive rates if confounding is controlled. Across traits, polygenicity varies, but the range of their effect sizes is similar. Compared with effect sizes in the top 10\% of heritability, including most discovered thus far, those in the bottom 10–50\% are orders of magnitude smaller and more numerous, spanning a large fraction of the genome.},

To test this hypothesis, we developed a method to estimate the proportion of disease heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression levels. The method, gene expression co-score regression (GECS regression), relies on the idea that, for a gene whose expression level affects a phenotype, SNPs with similar effects on the expression of that gene will have similar phenotypic effects. In order to distinguish directional effects mediated by gene expression from non-directional pleiotropic or tagging effects, GECS regression operates on pairs of cis SNPs in linkage equilibrium, regressing pairwise products of disease effect sizes on products of cis-eQTL effect sizes. We verified that GECS regression produces robust estimates of mediated effects in simulations. We applied the method to eQTL data in 44 tissues from the GTEx consortium (average \emph{N}\textsubscript{eQTL} = 158 samples) in conjunction with GWAS summary statistics for 30 diseases and complex traits (average \emph{N\textsubscript{GWAS}} = \emph{88K}) with low pairwise genetic correlation, estimating the proportion of SNP-heritability mediated by the cis-genetic component of assayed gene expression in the union of the 44 tissues. The mean estimate was 0.21 (s.e. = 0.01) across 30 traits, with a significantly positive estimate \emph{(p \&lt;} 0.001) for every trait. Thus, assayed gene expression in bulk tissues mediates a statistically significant but modest proportion of disease heritability, motivating the development of additional assays to capture regulatory effects and the use of our method to estimate how much disease heritability they mediate.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities by the tissue-sharing estimates for eQTLs, we generate relative tissue-causality profiles for GWAS traits. Our approach not only implicates the gene likely mediating individual GWAS signals, but also highlights tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is likely manifested.},

  abstract = {How to interpret the biological causes underlying the predisposing markers identified through genome-wide association studies (GWAS) remains an open question. One direct and powerful way to assess the genetic causality behind GWAS is through analysis of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Here we describe a new approach to estimate the tissues behind the genetic causality of a variety of GWAS traits, using the cis-eQTLs in 44 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium. We have adapted the regulatory trait concordance (RTC) score to measure the probability of eQTLs being active in multiple tissues and to calculate the probability that a GWAS-associated variant and an eQTL tag the same functional effect. By normalizing the GWAS-eQTL probabilities by the tissue-sharing estimates for eQTLs, we generate relative tissue-causality profiles for GWAS traits. Our approach not only implicates the gene likely mediating individual GWAS signals, but also highlights tissues where the genetic causality for an individual trait is likely manifested.},

Our database comprises macular and non-macular RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) profiles from 129 donors, a genome-wide expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) dataset that includes macula-specific retina and RPE/choroid, and single-nucleus RNA-seq (NucSeq) from human retina and RPE with subtype resolution from more than 100,000 cells. Using NucSeq, we find enriched expression of AMD candidate genes in RPE cells. We identify 15 putative causal genes for AMD on the basis of co-localization of genetic association signals for AMD risk and eye eQTL, including the genes TSPAN10 and TRPM1.

  abstract = {Standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90\% of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits. Using these highly predictive, trait-specific functional annotations, we estimate causality probabilities across all traits and variants, reducing the size of the 90\% confidence set from an average of 17.5 to 13.5 variants per locus in this data.},

It approximates a full posterior distribution with a factorized set of distributions by maximizing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. This requires the ability to integrate a sum of terms in the log joint likelihood using this factorized distribution. Often not all integrals are in closed form, which is typically handled by using a lower bound. We present an alternative algorithm based on stochastic optimization that allows for direct optimization of the variational lower bound. This method uses control variates to reduce the variance of the stochastic search gradient, in which existing lower bounds can play an important role. We demonstrate the approach on two non-conjugate models: logistic regression and an approximation to the HDP.},

In such studies, expression that deviates from defined thresholds commonly is used for creating genetic signatures that characterize disease vs. normality. Although it is axiomatic that the threshold parameters applied to microarray analysis will alter the contents of such genetic signatures, the extent to which threshold choice can affect the fundamental conclusions made from microarray-based studies has not been elucidated. We used GABRIEL (Genetic Analysis By Rules Incorporating Expert Logic), a platform of knowledge-based algorithms for the global analysis of gene expression, together with conventional statistical approaches, to examine the sensitivity of conclusions to threshold choice in recently published microarray-based studies. An analysis of the effects of threshold decisions in one of these studies [Ramaswamy, S., Ross, K. N., Lander, E. S. \& Golub, T. R. (2003) Nat. Genet. 33, 49-54], which arrived at the important conclusion that the metastatic potential of primary tumors is encoded by the bulk of cells in the tumor, is the focus of this article. We discovered that support for this conclusion highly depends on the threshold used to create gene expression signatures. We also found that threshold choice dramatically affected the gene function categories represented nonrandomly in signatures. Our results suggest that the robustness of biological conclusions made by using microarray analysis should be routinely assessed by examining the validity of the conclusions by using a range of threshold parameters.},

  abstract = {In learning-to-rank for information retrieval, a ranking model is automatically learned from the data and then utilized to rank the sets of retrieved documents. Therefore, an ideal ranking model would be a mapping from a document set to a permutation on the set, and should satisfy two critical requirements: (1)\textasciitilde it should have the ability to model cross-document interactions so as to capture local context information in a query; (2)\textasciitilde it should be permutation-invariant, which means that any permutation of the inputted documents would not change the output ranking. Previous studies on learning-to-rank either design uni-variate scoring functions that score each document separately, and thus failed to model the cross-document interactions; or construct multivariate scoring functions that score documents sequentially, which inevitably sacrifice the permutation invariance requirement. In this paper, we propose a neural learning-to-rank model called SetRank which directly learns a permutation-invariant ranking model defined on document sets of any size. SetRank employs a stack of (induced) multi-head self attention blocks as its key component for learning the embeddings for all of the retrieved documents jointly. The self-attention mechanism not only helps SetRank to capture the local context information from cross-document interactions, but also to learn permutation-equivariant representations for the inputted documents, which therefore achieving a permutation-invariant ranking model. Experimental results on three large scale benchmarks showed that the SetRank significantly outperformed the baselines include the traditional learning-to-rank models and state-of-the-art Neural IR models.},

The lack of common well-characterized cell lines that are used widely frustrates efforts to integrate data across research groups or replicate key findings. Inspired by model organism communities who addressed this issue by establishing a limited number of widely accepted strains, we characterised candidate iPSC lines in unprecedented detail to select a well-performing line to underpin collaborative studies. Specifically, we characterised the morphology, growth rates, and single-cell transcriptomes of iPSC lines in the pluripotent state and assessed their genomic integrity using karyotyping, DNA microarrays, whole genome sequencing, and functional assays for p53 activity. We further tested their ability to be edited by CRISPR/Cas9 and used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the efficiency with which they could be differentiated into multiple lineages. We found that there was significant variability in the performance of lines across the tested assays that enabled the rational selection of a lead line, KOLF2.1J, which is a genecorrected derivative of a publicly available line from the Human Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells Initiative (HipSci) resource. We are now using this line in an initiative from the NIH Center for Alzheimer’s and Related Dementias to derive hundreds of gene-edited and functionalized subclones to be distributed widely throughout the research community along with associated datasets, with the aim of promoting the standardisation required for large-scale collaborative science in the stem cell field.},

  abstract = {Schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric condition often associated with poor quality of life and decreased life expectancy. Lack of progress in improving treatment outcomes has been attributed to limited knowledge of the underlying biology, although large-scale genomic studies have begun to provide insights. We report a new genome-wide association study of schizophrenia (11,260 cases and 24,542 controls), and through meta-analysis with existing data we identify 50 novel associated loci and 145 loci in total. Through integrating genomic fine-mapping with brain expression and chromosome conformation data, we identify candidate causal genes within 33 loci. We also show for the first time that the common variant association signal is highly enriched among genes that are under strong selective pressures. These findings provide new insights into the biology and genetic architecture of schizophrenia, highlight the importance of mutation-intolerant genes and suggest a mechanism by which common risk variants persist in the population.},

  abstract = {Characterizing the intermediate phenotypes, such as gene expression, that mediate genetic effects on complex diseases is a fundamental problem in human genetics. Existing methods utilize genotypic data and summary statistics to identify putative disease genes, but cannot distinguish pleiotropy from causal mediation and are limited by overly strong assumptions about the data. To overcome these limitations, we develop Causal Multivariate Mediation within Extended Linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL), a novel Bayesian inference framework to jointly model multiple mediated and unmediated effects relying only on summary statistics. We show in simulation that CaMMEL accurately distinguishes between mediating and pleiotropic genes unlike existing methods. We applied CaMMEL to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and found 206 causal genes in sub-threshold loci (p {$<$} 10−4). We prioritized 21 genes which mediate at least 5\% of local genetic variance, disrupting innate immune pathways in AD.},

  abstract = {Comparative genomic studies in primates have the potential to reveal the genetic and mechanistic basis for human specific traits. These studies may also help us better understand inter-species phenotypic differences that are clinically relevant. Unfortunately, the obvious limitation on sample collection and experimentation in humans and non-human apes severely restrict our ability to perform dynamic comparative studies in primates. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), and their corresponding differentiated cells, may provide a suitable alternative system for dynamic comparative studies. Yet, to effectively use iPSCs and differentiated cells for comparative studies, one must characterize the extent to which these systems faithfully represent biological processes in primary tissues. To do so, we compared gene expression data from primary adult heart tissue and iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes from multiple human and chimpanzee individuals. We determined that gene expression in cultured cardiomyocytes from both human and chimpanzee is most similar to that of adult hearts compared to other adult tissues. Using a comparative framework, we found that 50\% of gene regulatory differences between human and chimpanzee hearts are also observed between species in cultured cardiomyocytes; conversely, inter-species regulatory differences seen in cardiomyocytes are found significantly more often in hearts than in other primary tissues. Our work provides a detailed description of the utility and limitation of differentiated cardiomyocytes as a system for comparative functional genomic studies in primates.},

Since a common use of a large matrix like H is to compute its product with various vectors, we derive a technique that directly calculates Hv, where v is an arbitrary vector. To calculate Hv, we first define a differential operator R               v               \{f(w)\} = (δ/δr)f(w + rv)|r=0, note that R               v               \{▽w\} = Hv and R               v               \{w\} = v, and then apply R               v               \{·\} to the equations used to compute ▽               w               . The result is an exact and numerically stable procedure for computing Hv, which takes about as much computation, and is about as local, as a gradient evaluation. We then apply the technique to a one pass gradient calculation algorithm (backpropagation), a relaxation gradient calculation algorithm (recurrent backpropagation), and two stochastic gradient calculation algorithms (Boltzmann machines and weight perturbation). Finally, we show that this technique can be used at the heart of many iterative techniques for computing various properties of H, obviating any need to calculate the full Hessian.},

  abstract = {Improved procedures, in terms of smaller missed discovery rates (MDR), for performing multiple hypotheses testing with weak and strong control of the family-wise error rate (FWER) or the false discovery rate (FDR) are developed and studied. The improvement over existing procedures such as the Šidák procedure for FWER control and the Benjamini–Hochberg (BH) procedure for FDR control is achieved by exploiting possible differences in the powers of the individual tests. Results signal the need to take into account the powers of the individual tests and to have multiple hypotheses decision functions which are not limited to simply using the individual p-values, as is the case, for example, with the Šidák, Bonferroni, or BH procedures. They also enhance understanding of the role of the powers of individual tests, or more precisely the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) functions of decision processes, in the search for better multiple hypotheses testing procedures. A decision-theoretic framework is utilized, and through auxiliary randomizers the procedures could be used with discrete or mixed-type data or with rank-based nonparametric tests. This is in contrast to existing p-value based procedures whose theoretical validity is contingent on each of these p-value statistics being stochastically equal to or greater than a standard uniform variable under the null hypothesis. Proposed procedures are relevant in the analysis of high-dimensional “large M, small n” data sets arising in the natural, physical, medical, economic and social sciences, whose generation and creation is accelerated by advances in high-throughput technology, notably, but not limited to, microarray technology.},

We introduce a statistic ψ (the directionality index) that detects asymmetries in the 2D allele frequency spectrum of pairs of population. These asymmetries are caused by the series of founder events that happen during an expansion and they arise because low frequency alleles tend to be lost during founder events, thus creating clines in the frequencies of surviving low-frequency alleles. Using simulations, we show that ψ is more powerful for detecting range expansions than both and clines in heterozygosity. We also show how we can adapt our approach to more complicated scenarios such as expansions with multiple origins or barriers to migration and we illustrate the utility of ψ by applying it to a data set from modern humans.},

Summarizing and visually representing these patterns of diversity has been a persistent goal for human geneticists, and has revealed that genetic differentiation is frequently correlated with geographic distance. However, most analytical methods to represent population structure do not incorporate geography directly, and it must be considered post hoc alongside a visual summary of the genetic structure. Here, we estimate “effective migration” surfaces to visualize how human genetic diversity is geographically structured. The results reveal local patterns of differentiation in detail and emphasize that while genetic similarity generally decays with geographic distance, the relationship is often subtly distorted. Overall, the visualizations provide a new perspective on genetics and geography in humans and insight to the geographic distribution of human genetic variation.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Increasing numbers of large scale single cell RNA-Seq projects are leading to a data explosion, which can only be fully exploited through data integration. A number of methods have been developed to combine diverse datasets by removing technical batch effects, but most are computationally intensive. To overcome the challenge of enormous datasets, we have developed BBKNN, an extremely fast graph-based data integration algorithm. We illustrate the power of BBKNN on large scale mouse atlasing data, and favourably benchmark its run time against a number of competing methods.},

However, chimpanzee tissue is inaccessible during neocortical neurogenesis when differences in brain size first appear. To identify human-specific features~of cortical development, we leveraged recent innovations~that permit generating pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoids from chimpanzee. Despite metabolic differences, organoid models preserve gene regulatory networks related to primary cell types and developmental processes. We further identified 261 differentially expressed genes in human compared to both chimpanzee organoids and macaque cortex, enriched for recent gene duplications, and including multiple regulators of PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling. We observed increased activation of this pathway in human radial glia, dependent on two receptors upregulated specifically in human: INSR and ITGB8. Our findings establish a platform for systematic analysis of molecular changes contributing to human brain development and evolution.},

The latent variables in the mixture representation lead to EM and ECME point estimates of SVM parameters, as well as MCMC algorithms based on Gibbs sampling that can bring Bayesian tools for Gaussian linear models to bear on SVM’s.

In simulations, PolyFun\,+\,SuSiE and PolyFun\,+\,FINEMAP were well calibrated and identified {$>$}20\% more variants with a posterior causal probability {$>$}0.95 than identified in their nonfunctionally informed counterparts. In analyses of 49 UK Biobank traits (average n\,=\,318,000), PolyFun\,+\,SuSiE identified 3,025 fine-mapped variant–trait pairs with posterior causal probability {$>$}0.95, a {$>$}32\% improvement versus SuSiE. We used posterior mean per-SNP heritabilities from PolyFun\,+\,SuSiE to perform polygenic localization, constructing minimal sets of common SNPs causally explaining 50\% of common SNP heritability; these sets ranged in size from 28 (hair color) to 3,400 (height) to 2 million (number of children).

  abstract = {Disentangling the effect on genomic diversity of natural selection from that of demography is notoriously difficult, but necessary to properly reconstruct the history of species. Here, we use high-quality human genomic data to show that purifying selection at linked sites (i.e. background selection, BGS) and GC-biased gene conversion (gBGC) together affect as much as 95\% of the variants of our genome. We find that the magnitude and relative importance of BGS and gBGC are largely determined by variation in recombination rate and base composition. Importantly, synonymous sites and non-transcribed regions are also affected, albeit to different degrees. Their use for demographic inference can lead to strong biases. However, by conditioning on genomic regions with recombination rates above 1.5 cM/Mb and mutation types (C↔G, A↔T), we identify a set of SNPs that is mostly unaffected by BGS or gBGC, and that avoids these biases in the reconstruction of human history.           ,              Human chromosomes are made up of DNA, which contains about 3 billion ‘letters’ that carry the instructions needed to build and maintain an individual. However, only about 10 percent of the human genome is made up of genes that code for proteins, or have a defined role in the body. The DNA sequence is largely the same in all people, but some modifications – or variants – occur about every hundred letters. These produce different versions of the same gene, which give us our unique features, such as the color of our hair or eyes.             The frequencies of some genetic variants can change over time, which makes human populations diverge genetically and physically. This can happen through different mechanisms. Positive selection keeps variants that are beneficial in specific environments, while negative selection removes genetic changes that are detrimental, for example because they cause disease. Transmission bias favors one of the two variants from our two parents. Chance alters the frequencies of neutral variants, which are neither good nor bad for the individual.             It is important to distinguish between these different scenarios, as they inform us about the forces that act on human evolution. For example, neutral variants tell us about the demography and migration patterns between populations. Variants under negative selection reveal which genetic areas are under pressure to stay the same because they are important for the organism to function correctly. Until now, it was unclear how we could best identify the variants affected by different evolutionary pressures, and how much of the genome was under negative selection.             Pouyet, Aeschbacher et al. created a measure of genetic diversity that is only affected by selection or transmission bias. The results showed that negative selection influences as much as 85 percent of our genome, whereas transmission bias affects a majority of the rest of the genome. After removing these two biases, less than 5 percent of the human genome is found to evolve by chance. This suggests that while most of our genetic material is formed of non-functional sequences, the vast majority of it evolves indirectly under some type of selection.             These findings define which parts of our genome evolves neutrally and can therefore be used to correctly reconstruct the past demography and migration events of humans around the world. The next step could be to reassess the history of human populations that was drawn using genomic data.},

In equilibrium without energy supply, directional motion cannot be sustained without violating the laws of thermodynamics. Under conditions away from thermodynamic equilibrium, directional motion may be achieved within the framework of Brownian ratchets, which are diffusive mechanisms that have broken inversion symmetry1–5. Ratcheting is thought to underpin the function of many natural biological motors, such as the F1F0-ATPase6–8, and it has been demonstrated experimentally in synthetic microscale systems (for example, to our knowledge, first in ref.\,3) and also in artificial molecular motors created by organic chemical synthesis9–12. DNA nanotechnology13 has yielded a variety of nanoscale mechanisms, including pivots, hinges, crank sliders and rotary systems14–17, which can adopt different configurations, for example, triggered by strand-displacement reactions18,19 or by changing environmental parameters such as pH, ionic strength, temperature, external fields and by coupling their motions to those of natural motor proteins20–26. This previous work and considering low-Reynolds-number dynamics and inherent stochasticity27,28 led us to develop a nanoscale rotary motor built from DNA origami that is driven by ratcheting and whose mechanical capabilities approach those of biological motors such as F1F0-ATPase.},

Previous studies have shown considerable links of GWAS signals to expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) but the links to other genetic regulatory mechanisms, such as splicing QTLs (sQTLs), are underexplored. Here, we introduce an sQTL mapping method, testing for heterogeneity between isoform-eQTL effects (THISTLE), with improved power over competing methods. Applying THISTLE together with a complementary sQTL mapping strategy to brain transcriptomic (n\,=\,2,865) and genotype data, we identified 12,794 genes with cis-sQTLs at P\,{$<$}\,5\,×\,10−8, approximately 61\% of which were distinct from eQTLs. Integrating the sQTL data into GWAS for 12 brain-related complex traits (including diseases), we identified 244 genes associated with the traits through cis-sQTLs, approximately 61\% of which could not be discovered using the corresponding eQTL data. Our study demonstrates the distinct role of most sQTLs in the genetic regulation of transcription and complex trait variation.},

  abstract = {Single-cell (sc)RNA-seq, together with RNA velocity and metabolic labeling, reveals cellular states and transitions at unprecedented resolution. Fully exploiting these data, however, requires kinetic models capable of unveiling governing regulatory functions. Here, we introduce an analytical framework dynamo (https://github. com/aristoteleo/dynamo-release), which infers absolute RNA velocity, reconstructs continuous vector fields that predict cell fates, employs differential geometry to extract underlying regulations, and ultimately predicts optimal reprogramming paths and perturbation outcomes. We highlight dynamo’s power to overcome fundamental limitations of conventional splicing-based RNA velocity analyses to enable accurate velocity estimations on a metabolically labeled human hematopoiesis scRNA-seq dataset. Furthermore, differential geometry analyses reveal mechanisms driving early megakaryocyte appearance and elucidate asymmetrical regulation within the PU.1-GATA1 circuit. Leveraging the least-action-path method, dynamo accurately predicts drivers of numerous hematopoietic transitions. Finally, in silico perturbations predict cell-fate diversions induced by gene perturbations. Dynamo, thus, represents an important step in advancing quantitative and predictive theories of cell-state transitions.},

While tensors first emerged in the psychometrics community in the \$20\^\{\textbackslash text\{th\}\}\$ century, they have since then spread to numerous other disciplines, including machine learning. Tensors and their decompositions are especially beneficial in unsupervised learning settings, but are gaining popularity in other sub-disciplines like temporal and multi-relational data analysis, too. The scope of this paper is to give a broad overview of tensors, their decompositions, and how they are used in machine learning. As part of this, we are going to introduce basic tensor concepts, discuss why tensors can be considered more rigid than matrices with respect to the uniqueness of their decomposition, explain the most important factorization algorithms and their properties, provide concrete examples of tensor decomposition applications in machine learning, conduct a case study on tensor-based estimation of mixture models, talk about the current state of research, and provide references to available software libraries.},

We propose a new approximation which uses only the output of standard computer programs for estimating generalised linear models; this appears to be quite accurate. A reference set of proper priors is suggested, both to represent the situation where there is not much prior information, and to assess the sensitivity of the results to the prior distribution. The methods can be used when the dispersion parameter is unknown, when there is overdispersion, to compare link functions, and to compare error distributions and variance functions. The methods can be used to implement the Bayesian approach to accounting for model uncertainty. We describe an application to inference about relative risks in the presence of control factors where model uncertainty is large and important. Software to implement the methods is available at no cost from StatLib.},

There is a multitude of tests available, ranging from aggregation tests that summarize gene-level statistics for a gene set to true multivariate tests, accounting for intergene correlations. Most of them detect complex departures from the null hypothesis but when the null hypothesis is rejected, the specific alternative leading to the rejection is not easily identifiable., Results: In this article we compare the power and Type I error rates of minimum-spanning tree (MST)-based non-parametric multivariate tests with several multivariate and aggregation tests, which are frequently used for pathway analyses. In our simulation study, we demonstrate that MST-based tests have power that is for many settings comparable with the power of conventional approaches, but outperform them in specific regions of the parameter space corresponding to biologically relevant configurations. Further, we find for simulated and for gene expression data that MST-based tests discriminate well against shift and scale alternatives. As a general result, we suggest a two-step practical analysis strategy that may increase the interpretability of experimental data: first, apply the most powerful multivariate test to find the subset of pathways for which the null hypothesis is rejected and second, apply MST-based tests to these pathways to select those that support specific alternative hypotheses., Contact: gvglazko@uams.edu or yrahmatallah@uams.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {The ApoE ε4 allele is the most significant genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer disease. The risk conferred by ε4, however, differs across populations, with populations of African ancestry showing lower ε4 risk compared to those of European or Asian ancestry. The cause of this heterogeneity in risk effect is currently unknown; it may be due to environmental or cultural factors correlated with ancestry, or it may be due to genetic variation local to the ApoE region that differs among populations. Exploring these hypotheses may lead to novel, population-specific therapeutics and risk predictions. To test these hypotheses, we analyzed ApoE genotypes and genome-wide array data in individuals from African American and Puerto Rican populations. A total of 1,766 African American and 220 Puerto Rican individuals with late-onset Alzheimer disease, and 3,730 African American and 169 Puerto Rican cognitively healthy individuals ({$>$} 65 years) participated in the study. We first assessed average ancestry across the genome (“global” ancestry) and then tested it for interaction with ApoE genotypes. Next, we assessed the ancestral background of ApoE alleles (“local” ancestry) and tested if ancestry local to ApoE influenced Alzheimer disease risk while controlling for global ancestry. Measures of global ancestry showed no interaction with ApoE risk (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.49; African American: p-value = 0.65). Conversely, ancestry local to the ApoE region showed an interaction with the ApoE ε4 allele in both populations (Puerto Rican: p-value = 0.019; African American: p-value = 0.005). ApoE ε4 alleles on an African background conferred a lower risk than those with a European ancestral background, regardless of population (Puerto Rican: OR = 1.26 on African background, OR = 4.49 on European; African American: OR = 2.34 on African background, OR = 3.05 on European background). Factors contributing to the lower risk effect in the ApoE gene ε4 allele are likely due to ancestry-specific genetic factors near ApoE rather than non-genetic ethnic, cultural, and environmental factors.},

Although such linear mixing estimation problems are generally highly non-convex, Gaussian approximations of belief propagation (BP) have proven to be computationally attractive and highly effective in a range of applications. Recently, Bayati and Montanari have provided a rigorous and extremely general analysis of a large class of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms that includes many Gaussian approximate BP methods. This paper extends their analysis to a larger class of algorithms to include what we call generalized AMP (G-AMP). G-AMP incorporates general (possibly non-AWGN) measurement channels. Similar to the AWGN output channel case, we show that the asymptotic behavior of the G-AMP algorithm under large i.i.d. Gaussian transform matrices is described by a simple set of state evolution (SE) equations. The general SE equations recover and extend several earlier results, including SE equations for approximate BP on general output channels by Guo and Wang.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Unique modeling and computational challenges arise in locating the geographic origin of individuals based on their genetic backgrounds. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) vary widely in informativeness, allele frequencies change non-linearly with geography and reliable localization requires evidence to be integrated across a multitude of SNPs. These problems become even more acute for individuals of mixed ancestry. It is hardly surprising that matching genetic models to computational constraints has limited the development of methods for estimating geographic origins. We attack these related problems by borrowing ideas from image processing and optimization theory. Our proposed model divides the region of interest into pixels and operates SNP by SNP. We estimate allele frequencies across the landscape by maximizing a product of binomial likelihoods penalized by nearest neighbor interactions. Penalization smooths allele frequency estimates and promotes estimation at pixels with no data. Maximization is accomplished by a minorize–maximize (MM) algorithm. Once allele frequency surfaces are available, one can apply Bayes’ rule to compute the posterior probability that each pixel is the pixel of origin of a given person. Placement of admixed individuals on the landscape is more complicated and requires estimation of the fractional contribution of each pixel to a person’s genome. This estimation problem also succumbs to a penalized MM algorithm. Results: We applied the model to the Population Reference Sample (POPRES) data. The model gives better localization for both unmixed and admixed individuals than existing methods despite using just a small fraction of the available SNPs. Computing times are comparable with the best competing software. Availability and implementation: Software will be freely available as the OriGen package in R.

  abstract = {Biological data analysis often deals with lists of genes arising from various studies. The g:Profiler toolset is widely used for finding biological categories enriched in gene lists, conversions between gene identifiers and mappings to their orthologs. The mission of g:Profiler is to provide a reliable service based on up-to-date high quality data in a convenient manner across many evidence types, identifier spaces and organisms. g:Profiler relies on Ensembl as a primary data source and follows their quarterly release cycle while updating the other data sources simultaneously. The current update provides a better user experience due to a modern responsive web interface, standardised API and libraries. The results are delivered through an interactive and configurable web design. Results can be downloaded as publication ready visualisations or delimited text files. In the current update we have extended the support to 467 species and strains, including vertebrates, plants, fungi, insects and parasites. By supporting user uploaded custom GMT files, g:Profiler is now capable of analysing data from any organism. All past releases are maintained for reproducibility and transparency. The 2019 update introduces an extensive technical rewrite making the services faster and more flexible. g:Profiler is freely available at https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gprofiler.},

  abstract = {Significant selection pressure has been exerted on the genomes of human populations exposed to Plasmodium falciparum infection, resulting in the acquisition of mechanisms of resistance against severe malarial disease. Many host genetic factors, including sickle cell trait, have been associated with reduced risk of developing severe malaria, but do not account for all of the observed phenotypic variation. Identification of novel inherited risk factors relies upon high-resolution genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We present findings of a GWAS of severe malaria performed in a Tanzanian population (n = 914, 15.2 million SNPs). Beyond the expected association with the sickle cell HbS variant, we identify protective associations within two interleukin receptors (IL-23R and IL-12RBR2) and the kelch-like protein KLHL3 (all P{$<$}10−6), as well as near significant effects for Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) haplotypes. Complementary analyses, based on detecting extended haplotype homozygosity, identified SYNJ2BP, GCLC and MHC as potential loci under recent positive selection. Through whole genome sequencing of an independent Tanzanian cohort (parent-child trios n = 247), we confirm the allele frequencies of common polymorphisms underlying associations and selection, as well as the presence of multiple structural variants that could be in linkage with these SNPs. Imputation of structural variants in a region encompassing the glycophorin genes on chromosome 4, led to the characterisation of more than 50 rare variants, and individually no strong evidence of associations with severe malaria in our primary dataset (P{$>$}0.3). Our approach demonstrates the potential of a joint genotyping-sequencing strategy to identify as-yet unknown susceptibility loci in an African population with well-characterised malaria phenotypes. The regions encompassing these loci are potential targets for the design of much needed interventions for preventing or treating malarial disease.},

Under compatibility conditions on the design matrix, oracle inequalities are derived for the mean-field VB approximation, implying that it converges to the sparse truth at the optimal rate and gives optimal prediction of the response vector. The empirical performance of our algorithm is studied, showing that it works comparably well as other state-of-the-art Bayesian variable selection methods. We also numerically demonstrate that the widely used coordinate-ascent variational inference algorithm can be highly sensitive to the parameter updating order, leading to potentially poor performance. To mitigate this, we propose a novel prioritized updating scheme that uses a data-driven updating order and performs better in simulations. The variational algorithm is implemented in the R package sparsevb. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

Due to the randomness inherent to the method, different runs of model-X knockoffs on the same dataset often result in different sets of selected variables, which is undesirable in practice. In this paper, we introduce a methodology for derandomizing model-X knockoffs with provable FDR control. The key insight of our proposed method lies in the discovery that the knockoffs procedure is in essence an e-BH procedure. We make use of this connection, and derandomize model-X knockoffs by aggregating the e-values resulting from multiple knockoff realizations. We prove that the derandomized procedure controls the FDR at the desired level, without any additional conditions (in contrast, previously proposed methods for derandomization are not able to guarantee FDR control). The proposed method is evaluated with numerical experiments, where we find that the derandomized procedure achieves comparable power and dramatically decreased selection variability when compared with model-X knockoffs.},

This paper introduces a derandomization method by aggregating the selection results across multiple runs of the knockoffs algorithm. The derandomization step is designed to be flexible and can be adapted to any variable selection base procedure to yield stable decisions without compromising statistical power. When applied to the base procedure of Janson et al. (2016), we prove that derandomized knockoffs controls both the per family error rate (PFER) and the k family-wise error rate (k-FWER). Further, we carry out extensive numerical studies demonstrating tight type-I error control and markedly enhanced power when compared with alternative variable selection algorithms. Finally, we apply our approach to multi-stage genome-wide association studies of prostate cancer and report locations on the genome that are significantly associated with the disease.

CADD is an integrative annotation built from more than 60 genomic features, and can score human single nucleotide variants and short insertion and deletions anywhere in the reference assembly. CADD uses a machine learning model trained on a binary distinction between simulated de novo variants and variants that have arisen and become fixed in human populations since the split between humans and chimpanzees; the former are free of selective pressure and may thus include both neutral and deleterious alleles, while the latter are overwhelmingly neutral (or, at most, weakly deleterious) by virtue of having survived millions of years of purifying selection. Here we review the latest updates to CADD, including the most recent version, 1.4, which supports the human genome build GRCh38. We also present updates to our website that include simplified variant lookup, extended documentation, an Application Program Interface and improved mechanisms for integrating CADD scores into other tools or applications.

However, signed annotations quantifying whether each SNP allele promotes or hinders the biological process can enable stronger statements about disease mechanism. We introduce a method, signed linkage disequilibrium profile regression, for detecting genome-wide directional effects of signed functional annotations on disease risk. We validate the method via simulations and application to molecular quantitative trait loci in blood, recovering known transcriptional regulators. We apply the method to expression quantitative trait loci in 48 Genotype-Tissue Expression tissues, identifying 651 transcription factor-tissue associations including 30 with robust evidence of tissue specificity. We apply the method to 46 diseases and complex traits (average n\,=\,290\,K), identifying 77 annotation-trait associations representing 12 independent transcription factor-trait associations, and characterize the underlying transcriptional programs using gene-set enrichment analyses. Our results implicate new causal disease genes and new disease mechanisms.},

  abstract = {Most disease-associated loci, though located in putatively regulatory regions, have not yet been confirmed to affect gene expression. One reason for this could be that we have not examined gene expression in the most relevant cell types or conditions. Indeed, even large-scale efforts to study gene expression broadly across tissues are limited by the necessity of obtaining human samples post-mortem, and almost exclusively from adults. Thus, there is an acute need to expand gene regulatory studies in humans to the most relevant cell types, tissues, and states. We propose that embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states, can provide an answer. Single cell RNA-sequencing now provides a way to interrogate developmental trajectories in EBs and enhance the potential to uncover dynamic regulatory processes that would be missed in studies of static adult tissue. Here, we examined the properties of the EB model for the purpose mapping inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.},

  abstract = {Practically all studies of gene expression in humans to date have been performed in a relatively small number of adult tissues. Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-­dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-­ individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.},

Here we show that usual normalization approaches mostly account for sequencing depth and fail to correct for library preparation and other more-complex unwanted effects. We evaluate the performance of the External RNA Control Consortium (ERCC) spike-in controls and investigate the possibility of using them directly for normalization. We show that the spike-ins are not reliable enough to be used in standard global-scaling or regression-based normalization procedures. We propose a normalization strategy, remove unwanted variation (RUV), that adjusts for nuisance technical effects by performing factor analysis on suitable sets of control genes (e.g., ERCC spike-ins) or samples (e.g., replicate libraries). Our approach leads to more-accurate estimates of expression fold-changes and tests of differential expression compared to state-of-the-art normalization methods. In particular, RUV promises to be valuable for large collaborative projects involving multiple labs, technicians, and/or platforms.},

  abstract = {Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide a powerful approach for uncovering diseaseassociated variants in human, but fine-mapping the causal variants remains a challenge. This is partly remedied by prioritization of disease-associated variants that overlap GWAS-enriched epigenomic annotations. Here, we introduce a new Bayesian model RiVIERA (Risk Variant Inference using Epigenomic Reference Annotations) for inference of driver variants from summary statistics across multiple traits using hundreds of epigenomic annotations. In simulation, RiVIERA promising power in detecting causal variants and causal annotations, the multi-trait joint inference further improved the detection power. We applied RiVIERA to model the existing GWAS summary statistics of 9 autoimmune diseases and Schizophrenia by jointly harnessing the potential causal enrichments among 848 tissue-specific epigenomics annotations from ENCODE/Roadmap consortium covering 127 cell/tissue types and 8 major epigenomic marks. RiVIERA identified meaningful tissue-specific enrichments for enhancer regions defined by H3K4me1 and H3K27ac for Blood TCell specifically in the nine autoimmune diseases and Brain-specific enhancer activities exclusively in Schizophrenia. Moreover, the variants from the 95\% credible sets exhibited high conservation and enrichments for GTEx whole-blood eQTLs located within transcription-factor-binding-sites and DNAhypersensitive-sites. Furthermore, joint modeling the nine immune traits by simultaneously inferring and exploiting the underlying epigenomic correlation between traits further improved the functional enrichments compared to single-trait models.},

We develop a weighted multiple testing procedure that facilitates the input of prior information in the form of groupings of tests. For each group a weight is estimated from the observed test statistics within the group. Differentially weighting groups improves the power to detect signals in likely groupings. The advantage of the grouped-weighting concept, over fixed weights based on prior information, is that it often leads to an increase in power even if many of the groupings are not correlated with the signal. Being data dependent, the procedure is remarkably robust to poor choices in groupings. Power is typically improved if one (or more) of the groups clusters multiple tests with signals, yet little power is lost when the groupings are totally random. If there is no apparent signal in a group, relative to a group that appears to have several tests with signals, the former group will be down-weighted relative to the latter. If no groups show apparent signals, then the weights will be approximately equal. The only restriction on the procedure is that the number of groups be small, relative to the total number of tests performed. Genet. Epidemiol. 2007. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We do this by observing that the guarantees of algorithms with bounded approximate max-information are sufficient to correct the \$p\$-values of adaptively chosen hypotheses, and then by proving that algorithms that satisfy \$(\textbackslash epsilon,\textbackslash delta)\$-differential privacy have bounded approximate max information when their inputs are drawn from a product distribution. This substantially extends the known connection between differential privacy and max-information, which previously was only known to hold for (pure) \$(\textbackslash epsilon,0)\$-differential privacy. It also extends our understanding of max-information as a partially unifying measure controlling the generalization properties of adaptive data analyses. We also show a lower bound, proving that (despite the strong composition properties of max-information), when data is drawn from a product distribution, \$(\textbackslash epsilon,\textbackslash delta)\$-differentially private algorithms can come first in a composition with other algorithms satisfying max-information bounds, but not necessarily second if the composition is required to itself satisfy a nontrivial max-information bound. This, in particular, implies that the connection between \$(\textbackslash epsilon,\textbackslash delta)\$-differential privacy and max-information holds only for inputs drawn from product distributions, unlike the connection between \$(\textbackslash epsilon,0)\$-differential privacy and max-information.},

  abstract = {Cesario et al. argue that benchmarking the relative counts of killings by police on relative crime rates, rather than relative population sizes, generates a measure of racial disparity in the use of lethal force that is unbiased by differential crime rates. Their publication, however, lacked any formal derivation showing that their benchmarking methodology has the statistical properties required to establish such a claim. We use the causal model of lethal force by police conditional on relative crime rates implicit in their analyses and prove that their benchmarking methodology does not, in general, remove the bias introduced by crime rate differences. Instead, it creates strong statistical biases that mask true racial disparities, especially in the killing of unarmed noncriminals by police. Reanalysis of their data using formally derived criminality-correcting benchmarks shows that there is strong and statistically reliable evidence of anti-Black racial disparities in the killing of unarmed Americans by police in 2015?2016.},

However, variant-level associations are hard to identify and can be difficult to interpret biologically. Enrichment analyses help address both problems by targeting sets of biologically related variants. Here we introduce a new model-based enrichment method that requires only GWAS summary statistics. Applying this method to interrogate 4,026 gene sets in 31 human phenotypes identifies many previously-unreported enrichments, including enrichments of endochondral ossification pathway for height, NFAT-dependent transcription pathway for rheumatoid arthritis, brain-related genes for coronary artery disease, and liver-related genes for Alzheimer’s disease. A key feature of our method is that inferred enrichments automatically help identify new trait-associated genes. For example, accounting for enrichment in lipid transport genes highlights association between MTTP and low-density lipoprotein levels, whereas conventional analyses of the same data found no significant variants near this gene.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) have attenuated cross-population predictive performance. As existing genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been conducted predominantly in individuals of European descent, the limited transferability of PRS reduces their clinical value in non-European populations, and may exacerbate healthcare disparities. Recent efforts to level ancestry imbalance in genomic research have expanded the scale of non-European GWAS, although most remain underpowered. Here, we present a new PRS construction method, PRS-CSx, which improves cross-population polygenic prediction by integrating GWAS summary statistics from multiple populations. PRS-CSx couples genetic effects across populations via a shared continuous shrinkage (CS) prior, enabling more accurate effect size estimation by sharing information between summary statistics and leveraging linkage disequilibrium diversity across discovery samples, while inheriting computational efficiency and robustness from PRS-CS. We show that PRS-CSx outperforms alternative methods across traits with a wide range of genetic architectures, cross-population genetic overlaps and discovery GWAS sample sizes in simulations, and improves the prediction of quantitative traits and schizophrenia risk in non-European populations.},

It includes, among others, (generalized) linear models, (generalized) additive models, smoothing spline models, state space models, semiparametric regression, spatial and spatiotemporal models, log-Gaussian Cox processes and geostatistical and geoadditive models. We consider approximate Bayesian inference in a popular subset of structured additive regression models, latent Gaussian models, where the latent field is Gaussian, controlled by a few hyperparameters and with non-Gaussian response variables. The posterior marginals are not available in closed form owing to the non-Gaussian response variables. For such models, Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be implemented, but they are not without problems, in terms of both convergence and computational time. In some practical applications, the extent of these problems is such that Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling is simply not an appropriate tool for routine analysis. We show that, by using an integrated nested Laplace approximation and its simplified version, we can directly compute very accurate approximations to the posterior marginals. The main benefit of these approximations is computational: where Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms need hours or days to run, our approximations provide more precise estimates in seconds or minutes. Another advantage with our approach is its generality, which makes it possible to perform Bayesian analysis in an automatic, streamlined way, and to compute model comparison criteria and various predictive measures so that models can be compared and the model under study can be challenged.},

  abstract = {In multiple-testing problems, where a large number of hypotheses are tested simultaneously, false discovery rate (FDR) control can be achieved with the well-known Benjamini–Hochberg procedure, which adapts to the amount of signal in the data, under certain distributional assumptions. Many modifications of this procedure have been proposed to improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce the ‘structure-adaptive Benjamini–Hochberg algorithm’ (SABHA) as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. The SABHA method incorporates prior information about any predetermined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that the SABHA method controls the FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the data—interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights. We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including ordered, grouped and low total variation structures, and obtain the bounds on the FDR for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of the SABHA method on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity data and on gene–drug response data, as well as on simulated data.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Despite numerous methodological advances, the normalization of single cell RNA-seq (scRNAseq) data remains a challenging task. The performance of different methods can vary greatly across datasets. Part of the reason for this is the different kinds of unwanted variation, including library size, batch and cell cycle effects, and the association of these with the biology embodied in the cells. A normalization method that does not explicitly take into account cell biology risks removing some of the signal of interest. Here we propose RUV-III-NB, a statistical method that can be used to adjust counts for library size and batch effects. The method uses the concept of pseudo-replicates to ensure that relevant features of the unwanted variation are only inferred from cells with the same biology and return adjusted sequencing count as output. Results: Using five publicly available datasets that encompass different technological platforms, kinds of biology and levels of association between biology and unwanted variation, we show that RUV-III-NB manages to remove library size and batch effects, strengthen biological signals, improve differential expression analyses, and lead to results exhibiting greater concordance with independent datasets of the same kind. The performance of RUV-III-NB is consistent across the five datasets and is not sensitive to the number of factors assumed to contribute to the unwanted variation. It also shows promise for removing other kinds of unwanted variation such as platform effects. Availability: The method is implemented as a publicly available R package available from https://github.com/limfuxing/ruvIIInb.},

Here, we hypothesized that Epromoters play a key role in the coordination of rapid gene induction during the inflammatory response. Using a high-throughput reporter assay we explored the function of Epromoters in response to type I interferon. We find that clusters of IFNa-induced genes are frequently associated with Epromoters and that these regulatory elements preferentially recruit the STAT1/2 and IRF transcription factors and distally regulate the activation of interferon-response genes. Consistently, we identified and validated the involvement of Epromoter-containing clusters in the regulation of LPS-stimulated macrophages. Our findings suggest that Epromoters function as a local hub recruiting the key TFs required for coordinated regulation of gene clusters during the inflammatory response.},

  author = {Santini, Alberto},
  abstract = {In the min-Knapsack problem, one is given a set of items, each having a certain cost and weight. The objective is to select a subset with minimum cost, such that the sum of the weights is not smaller than a given constant. In this paper we introduce an extension of the min-Knapsack problem with additional “compactness constraints” (mKPC), stating that selected items cannot lie too far apart from each other. This extension has applications in algorithms for change-point detection in time series and for variable selection in high-dimensional statistics. We propose three solution methods for the mKPC. The first two methods use the same Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) formulation, but with two different approaches: either passing the complete model with a quadratic number of constraints to a black-box MIP solver or dynamically separating the constraints using a branch-andcut algorithm. Numerical experiments highlight the advantages of this dynamic separation. The third approach is a dynamic programming labelling algorithm. Finally, we focus on the special case of the unit-cost mKPC (1c-mKPC), which has a specific interpretation in the context of the statistical applications mentioned above. We prove that the 1c-mKPC is solvable in polynomial time with a different ad-hoc dynamic programming algorithm. Experimental results show that this algorithm vastly outperforms both generic approaches for the mKPC, as well as a simple greedy heuristic from the literature.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of estimating the density of a random variable when precise measurements on the variable are not available, but replicated proxies contaminated with measurement error are available for sufficiently many subjects. Under the assumption of additive measurement errors this reduces to a problem of deconvolution of densities. Deconvolution methods often make restrictive and unrealistic assumptions about the density of interest and the distribution of measurement errors, e.g., normality and homoscedasticity and thus independence from the variable of interest. This article relaxes these assumptions and introduces novel Bayesian semiparametric methodology based on Dirichlet process mixture models for robust deconvolution of densities in the presence of conditionally heteroscedastic measurement errors. In particular, the models can adapt to asymmetry, heavy tails and multimodality. In simulation experiments, we show that our methods vastly outperform a recent Bayesian approach based on estimating the densities via mixtures of splines. We apply our methods to data from nutritional epidemiology. Even in the special case when the measurement errors are homoscedastic, our methodology is novel and dominates other methods that have been proposed previously. Additional simulation results, instructions on getting access to the data set and R programs implementing our methods are included as part of online supplemental materials.},

The high proportion of zero counts in a typical scRNA-seq data matrix has garnered particular attention, and lead to widespread but inconsistent use of terminology such as “dropout” and “missing data.” Here, we argue that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and outline simple ways of thinking about models for scRNA-seq data that can help avoid this confusion. The key ideas are: (1) observed scRNA-seq counts reflect both the actual expression level of each gene in each cell and the measurement process, and it is important for models to explicitly distinguish contributions from these two distinct factors; and (2) the measurement process can be adequately described by a simple Poisson model, a claim for which we provide both theoretical and empirical support. We show how these ideas lead to a simple, flexible statistical framework which encompasses a number of commonly used models and analysis methods, and how this framework makes explicit their different assumptions and helps interpret their results. We also illustrate how explicitly separating models for expression and measurement can help address questions of biological interest, such as whether mRNA expression levels are multi-modal among cells.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

We functionally relate the odds of gene set membership with the significance of differential expression, and calculate adjusted P-values as a measure of statistical significance. The new approach is compared with Fisher's exact test and other relevant methods in a simulation study and in the analysis of two breast cancer datasets.

  abstract = {The Bayesian framework provides a principled way of model selection. This framework estimates a probability distribution over an ensemble of models, and the prediction is done by averaging over the ensemble of models. Accordingly, the uncertainty of the models is taken into account, and complex models with more degrees of freedom are penalized. However, integration over model parameters is often intractable, and some approximation scheme is needed.             Recently, a powerful approximation scheme, called the variational bayes (VB) method, has been proposed. This approach defines the free energy for a trial probability distribution, which approximates a joint posterior probability distribution over model parameters and hidden variables. The exact maximization of the free energy gives the true posterior distribution. The VB method uses factorized trial distributions. The integration over model parameters can be done analytically, and an iterative expectation-maximization-like algorithm, whose convergence is guaranteed, is derived.             In this article, we derive an online version of the VB algorithm and prove its convergence by showing that it is a stochastic approximation for finding the maximum of the free energy. By combining sequential model selection procedures, the online VB method provides a fully online learning method with a model selection mechanism. In preliminary experiments using synthetic data, the online VB method was able to adapt the model structure to dynamic environments.},

Here we present single cell transcriptomic data from 1812 individually resolved developing zebrafish embryos, encompassing 19 time points, 23 genetic perturbations, and totaling 3.2M cells. The high degree of replication in our study (8 or more embryos per condition) allows us to estimate the variance in cell type abundance organism-wide and to detect perturbation-dependent deviance in cell type composition relative to wild type embryos. Our approach is sensitive to rare cell types, resolving developmental trajectories and genetic dependencies in the cranial ganglia neurons, a cell population that comprises less than 1\% of the embryo. Additionally, time-series profiling of individual mutants identified a group of brachyury-independent cells with strikingly similar transcriptomes to notochord sheath cells, leading to new hypotheses about the origins of the skull. We anticipate that standardized collection of high-resolution, organism-scale single cell data from large numbers of individual embryos will enable mapping the genetic dependencies of zebrafish cell types, while also addressing long-standing challenges in developmental genetics, including the cellular and transcriptional plasticity underlying phenotypic diversity across individuals.},

However, there is now cross-pollination and increasing interest in both fields to benefit from the advances of the other. In the present paper, we review fundamental concepts of causal inference and relate them to crucial open problems of machine learning, including transfer and generalization, thereby assaying how causality can contribute to modern machine learning research. This also applies in the opposite direction: we note that most work in causality starts from the premise that the causal variables are given. A central problem for AI and causality is, thus, causal representation learning, the discovery of high-level causal variables from low-level observations. Finally, we delineate some implications of causality for machine learning and propose key research areas at the intersection of both communities.},

  abstract = {Recent results indicate that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to explain much of the heritability of common complex phenotypes, but methods are lacking to reliably identify the remaining associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We applied stratified False Discovery Rate (sFDR) methods to leverage genic enrichment in GWAS summary statistics data to uncover new loci likely to replicate in independent samples. Specifically, we use linkage disequilibrium-weighted annotations for each SNP in combination with nominal p-values to estimate the True Discovery Rate (TDR = 1−FDR) for strata determined by different genic categories. We show a consistent pattern of enrichment of polygenic effects in specific annotation categories across diverse phenotypes, with the greatest enrichment for SNPs tagging regulatory and coding genic elements, little enrichment in introns, and negative enrichment for intergenic SNPs. Stratified enrichment directly leads to increased TDR for a given p-value, mirrored by increased replication rates in independent samples. We show this in independent Crohn's disease GWAS, where we find a hundredfold variation in replication rate across genic categories. Applying a well-established sFDR methodology we demonstrate the utility of stratification for improving power of GWAS in complex phenotypes, with increased rejection rates from 20\% in height to 300\% in schizophrenia with traditional FDR and sFDR both fixed at 0.05. Our analyses demonstrate an inherent stratification among GWAS SNPs with important conceptual implications that can be leveraged by statistical methods to improve the discovery of loci.},

  abstract = {A major aim of association studies is the identification of polymorphisms (usually SNPs) associated with a trait. Tests of association may be based on individual SNPs or on sets of neighboring SNPs, by use of (for example) a product P value method or Hotelling’s T test. Linkage disequilibrium, the nonindependence of SNPs in physical proximity, causes problems for all these tests. First, multiple-testing correction for individual-SNP tests or for multilocus tests either leads to conservative P values (if Bonferroni correction is used) or is computationally expensive (if permutation is used). Second, calculation of product P values usually requires permutation. Here, we present the direct simulation approach (DSA), a method that accurately approximates P values obtained by permutation but is much faster. It may be used whenever tests are based on score statistics—for example, with Armitage’s trend test or its multivariate analogue. The DSA can be used with binary, continuous, or count traits and allows adjustment for covariates. We demonstrate the accuracy of the DSA on real and simulated data and illustrate how it might be used in the analysis of a whole-genome association study.},

  abstract = {A wide range of problems such as signal reconstruction, denoising, source separation, feature selection, and graphical model search are addressed today by posterior maximization for linear models with sparsity-favouring prior distributions. The Bayesian posterior contains useful information far beyond its mode, which can be used to drive methods for sampling optimization (active learning), feature relevance ranking, or hyperparameter estimation, if only this representation of uncertainty can be approximated in a tractable manner. In this paper, we review recent results for variational sparse inference, and show that they share underlying computational primitives. We discuss how sampling optimization can be implemented as sequential Bayesian experimental design. While there has been tremendous recent activity to develop sparse estimation, little attendance has been given to sparse approximate inference. In this paper, we argue that many problems in practice, such as compressive sensing for real-world image reconstruction, are served much better by proper uncertainty approximations than by ever more aggressive sparse estimation algorithms. Moreover, since some variational inference methods have been given strong convex optimization characterizations recently, theoretical analysis may become possible, promising new insights into nonlinear experimental design.},

After decades during which estimates were based on indirect approaches, notably on inferences from evolutionary patterns, it is now feasible to count de novo mutations in transmissions from parents to offspring. Surprisingly, this direct approach yields a mutation rate that is twofold lower than previous estimates, calling into question our understanding of the chronology of human evolution and raising the possibility that mutation rates have evolved relatively rapidly. Here, we bring together insights from studies of human genetics and molecular evolution, focusing on where they conflict and what the discrepancies tell us about important open questions. We begin by outlining various methods for studying the properties of mutations in humans. We review what we have learned from their applications about genomic factors that influence mutation rates and the effects of sex, age, and other sources of interindividual variation. We then consider the mutation rate as a product of evolution and discuss how and why it may have changed over time in primates.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked hundreds of loci to cardiac diseases. However, in most loci the causal variants and their target genes remain unknown. We developed a combined experimental and analytical approach that integrates single cell epigenomics with GWAS to prioritize risk variants and genes. We profiled accessible chromatin in single cells obtained from human hearts and leveraged the data to study genetics of Atrial Fibrillation (AF), the most common cardiac arrhythmia. Enrichment analysis of AF risk variants using cell-type-resolved open chromatin regions (OCRs) implicated cardiomyocytes as the main mediator of AF risk. We then performed statistical fine-mapping, leveraging the information in OCRs, and identified putative causal variants in 122 AF-associated loci. Taking advantage of the fine-mapping results, our novel statistical procedure for gene discovery prioritized 45 high-confidence risk genes, highlighting transcription factors and signal transduction pathways important for heart development. We further leveraged our single-cell data to study genetics of gene expression. An unexpected finding from earlier studies is that expression QTLs (eQTLs) are often shared across tissues even though most regulatory elements are cell-type specific. We found that this sharing is largely driven by the limited power of eQTL studies using bulk tissues to detect cell-type-specific regulatory variants. This finding points to an important limitation of using eQTLs to interpret GWAS of complex traits. In summary, our analysis provides a comprehensive map of AF risk variants and genes, and a general framework to integrate single-cell genomics with genetic studies of complex traits.},

  abstract = {We introduce a new framework for the analysis of association studies, designed to allow untyped variants to be more effectively and directly tested for association with a phenotype. The idea is to combine knowledge on patterns of correlation among SNPs (e.g., from the International HapMap project or resequencing data in a candidate region of interest) with genotype data at tag SNPs collected on a phenotyped study sample, to estimate (“impute”) unmeasured genotypes, and then assess association between the phenotype and these estimated genotypes. Compared with standard single-SNP tests, this approach results in increased power to detect association, even in cases in which the causal variant is typed, with the greatest gain occurring when multiple causal variants are present. It also provides more interpretable explanations for observed associations, including assessing, for each SNP, the strength of the evidence that it (rather than another correlated SNP) is causal. Although we focus on association studies with quantitative phenotype and a relatively restricted region (e.g., a candidate gene), the framework is applicable and computationally practical for whole genome association studies.

Instead, we recognize that genotypes can be considered as a random sample from an appropriate model, encapsulating our knowledge of genetic inheritance and human populations. This allows the generation of imperfect copies (knockoffs) of these variables that serve as ideal negative controls, correcting for linkage disequilibrium and accounting for unknown population structure, which may be due to diverse ancestries or familial relatedness. The validity and effectiveness of our method are demonstrated by extensive simulations and by applications to the UK Biobank data.

This paper introduces a simpler way of reporting statistical evidence: report the outcome of a bet against the null hypothesis. This leads to a new role for likelihood, to alternatives to power and confidence, and to a framework for meta-analysis that accommodates both planned and opportunistic testing of statistical hypotheses and probabilistic forecasts.

  abstract = {It is a common saying that testing for conditional independence, i.e., testing whether whether two random vectors \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are independent, given \$Z\$, is a hard statistical problem if \$Z\$ is a continuous random variable (or vector). In this paper, we prove that conditional independence is indeed a particularly difficult hypothesis to test for. Valid statistical tests are required to have a size that is smaller than a predefined significance level, and different tests usually have power against a different class of alternatives. We prove that a valid test for conditional independence does not have power against any alternative. Given the non-existence of a uniformly valid conditional independence test, we argue that tests must be designed so their suitability for a particular problem may be judged easily. To address this need, we propose in the case where \$X\$ and \$Y\$ are univariate to nonlinearly regress \$X\$ on \$Z\$, and \$Y\$ on \$Z\$ and then compute a test statistic based on the sample covariance between the residuals, which we call the generalised covariance measure (GCM). We prove that validity of this form of test relies almost entirely on the weak requirement that the regression procedures are able to estimate the conditional means \$X\$ given \$Z\$, and \$Y\$ given \$Z\$, at a slow rate. We extend the methodology to handle settings where \$X\$ and \$Y\$ may be multivariate or even high-dimensional. While our general procedure can be tailored to the setting at hand by combining it with any regression technique, we develop the theoretical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. A simulation study shows that the test based on GCM is competitive with state of the art conditional independence tests. Code is available as the R package GeneralisedCovarianceMeasure on CRAN.},

Approaches using sparsity-inducing penalty functions such as the Lasso can be useful for producing interpretable models. However, when the number variables runs into the thousands, and so even two-way interactions number in the millions, these methods may become computationally infeasible. Typically variable screening based on model fits using only main effects must be performed first. One problem with screening is that important variables may be missed if they are only useful for prediction when certain interaction terms are also present in the model.},

Analyzing spatial transcriptomic data is computationally challenging, as the data collected from various spatial transcriptomic technologies are often noisy and display substantial spatial correlation across tissue locations. Here, we develop a spatially-aware dimension reduction method, SpatialPCA, that can extract a low dimensional representation of the spatial transcriptomics data with biological signal and preserved spatial correlation structure, thus unlocking many existing computational tools previously developed in single-cell RNAseq studies for tailored analysis of spatial transcriptomics. We illustrate the benefits of SpatialPCA for spatial domain detection and explores its utility for trajectory inference on the tissue and for high-resolution spatial map construction. In the real data applications, SpatialPCA identifies key molecular and immunological signatures in a detected tumor surrounding microenvironment, including a tertiary lymphoid structure that shapes the gradual transcriptomic transition during tumorigenesis and metastasis. In addition, SpatialPCA detects the past neuronal developmental history that underlies the current transcriptomic landscape across tissue locations in the cortex.},

Eight of ten subgroups split from Uniprot Keyword annotation were assigned to specific types.

These phenotypes are commonly measured using high-throughput sequencing assays (e.g., RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq), which provide high-resolution count data that reflect how the phenotypes vary along the genome. Multiple methods have been proposed to help exploit these high-resolution measurements for differential expression analysis. However, they ignore the count nature of the data, instead using normal approximations that work well only for data with large sample sizes or high counts. Here we develop count-based methods to address this problem. We model the data for each sample using an inhomogeneous Poisson process with spatially structured underlying intensity function, and then, building on multi-scale models for the Poisson process, estimate and test for differences in the underlying intensity function across samples (or groups of samples). Using both simulation and real ATAC-seq data we show that our method outperforms previous normal-based methods, especially in situations with small sample sizes or low counts.},

Overall, this study demonstrates the ability to generate specific cooperative tissues originating from different germ lineages within a single organoid model, an advance that will further the examination of multi-tissue interactions during development and disease.},

  abstract = {Human genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are revealing the genetic architecture of anthropomorphic and biomedical traits, i.e., the frequencies and effect sizes of variants that contribute to heritable variation in a trait. To interpret these findings, we need to understand how genetic architecture is shaped by basic population genetics processes—notably, by mutation, natural selection, and genetic drift. Because many quantitative traits are subject to stabilizing selection and because genetic variation that affects one trait often affects many others, we model the genetic architecture of a focal trait that arises under stabilizing selection in a multidimensional trait space. We solve the model for the phenotypic distribution and allelic dynamics at steady state and derive robust, closed-form solutions for summary statistics of the genetic architecture. Our results provide a simple interpretation for missing heritability and why it varies among traits. They predict that the distribution of variances contributed by loci identified in GWASs is well approximated by a simple functional form that depends on a single parameter: the expected contribution to genetic variance of a strongly selected site affecting the trait. We test this prediction against the results of GWASs for height and body mass index (BMI) and find that it fits the data well, allowing us to make inferences about the degree of pleiotropy and mutational target size for these traits. Our findings help to explain why the GWAS for height explains more of the heritable variance than the similarly sized GWAS for BMI and to predict the increase in explained heritability with study sample size. Considering the demographic history of European populations, in which these GWASs were performed, we further find that most of the associations they identified likely involve mutations that arose shortly before or during the Out-of-Africa bottleneck at sites with selection coefficients around s = 10−3.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many disease associated loci, the majority of which have unknown biological functions. Understanding the mechanism underlying trait associations requires identifying trait-relevant tissues and investigating associations in a trait-specific fashion. Here, we extend the widely used linear mixed model to incorporate multiple SNP functional annotations from omics studies with GWAS summary statistics to facilitate the identification of trait-relevant tissues, with which to further construct powerful association tests. Specifically, we rely on a generalized estimating equation based algorithm for parameter inference, a mixture modeling framework for trait-tissue relevance classification, and a weighted sequence kernel association test constructed based on the identified trait-relevant tissues for powerful association analysis. We refer to our analytic procedure as the Scalable Multiple Annotation integration for trait-Relevant Tissue identification and usage (SMART). With extensive simulations, we show how our method can make use of multiple complementary annotations to improve the accuracy for identifying trait-relevant tissues. In addition, our procedure allows us to make use of the inferred trait-relevant tissues, for the first time, to construct more powerful SNP set tests. We apply our method for an in-depth analysis of 43 traits from 28 GWASs using tissue-specific annotations in 105 tissues derived from ENCODE and Roadmap. Our results reveal new trait-tissue relevance, pinpoint important annotations that are informative of trait-tissue relationship, and illustrate how we can use the inferred trait-relevant tissues to construct more powerful association tests in the Wellcome trust case control consortium study.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in human stem cell-derived brain organoids promise to replicate critical molecular and cellular aspects of learning and memory and possibly aspects of cognition in vitro. Coining the term “organoid intelligence” (OI) to encompass these developments, we present a collaborative program to implement the vision of a multidisciplinary field of OI. This aims to establish OI as a form of genuine biological computing that harnesses brain organoids using scientific and bioengineering advances in an ethically responsible manner. Standardized, 3D, myelinated brain organoids can now be produced with high cell density and enriched levels of glial cells and gene expression critical for learning. Integrated microfluidic perfusion systems can support scalable and durable culturing, and spatiotemporal chemical signaling. Novel 3D microelectrode arrays permit high-resolution spatiotemporal electrophysiological signaling and recording to explore the capacity of brain organoids to recapitulate the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory formation and, ultimately, their computational potential. Technologies that could enable novel biocomputing models via stimulus-response training and organoid-computer interfaces are in development. We envisage complex, networked interfaces whereby brain organoids are connected with real-world sensors and output devices, and ultimately with each other and with sensory organ organoids (e.g. retinal organoids), and are trained using biofeedback, big-data warehousing, and machine learning methods. In parallel, we emphasize an embedded ethics approach to analyze the ethical aspects raised by OI research in an iterative, collaborative manner involving all relevant stakeholders. The many possible applications of this research urge the strategic development of OI as a scientific discipline. We anticipate OI-based biocomputing systems to allow faster decision-making, continuous learning during tasks, and greater energy and data efficiency. Furthermore, the development of “intelligence-in-a-dish” could help elucidate the pathophysiology of devastating developmental and degenerative diseases (such as dementia), potentially aiding the identification of novel therapeutic approaches to address major global unmet needs.},

  abstract = {The β-hemoglobinopathies are inherited disorders resulting from altered coding potential or expression of the adult β-globin gene. Impaired expression of β-globin reduces adult hemoglobin (α2β2) production, the hallmark of β-thalassemia. A single-base mutation at codon 6 leads to formation of HbS (α2βS2) and sickle cell disease. While the basis of these diseases is known, therapy remains largely supportive. Bone marrow transplantation is the only curative therapy. Patients with elevated levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF, α2γ2) as adults exhibit reduced symptoms and enhanced survival. The β-globin gene locus is a paradigm of cell- and developmental stage-specific regulation. Although the principal erythroid cell transcription factors are known, mechanisms responsible for silencing of the γ-globin gene were obscure until application of genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Here, we review findings in the field. GWAS identified BCL11A as a candidate negative regulator of γ-globin expression. Subsequent studies have established BCL11A as a quantitative repressor. GWAS-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms lie within an essential erythroid enhancer of the BCL11A gene. Disruption of a discrete region within the enhancer reduces BCL11A expression and induces HbF expression, providing the basis for gene therapy using gene editing tools. A recently identified, second silencing factor, leukemia/lymphoma-related factor/Pokemon, shares features with BCL11A, including interaction with the nucleosome remodeling deacetylase repressive complex. These findings suggest involvement of a common pathway for HbF silencing. In addition, we discuss other factors that may be involved in γ-globin gene silencing and their potential manipulation for therapeutic benefit in treating the β-hemoglobinopathies.},

However, the lfdr is difficult to work with in small samples, as the prior distribution is typically unknown. We propose a simple multiple testing procedure and prove that it controls the expectation of the maximum lfdr across all rejections; equivalently, it controls the probability that the rejection with the largest p-value is a false discovery. Our method operates without knowledge of the prior, assuming only that the p-value density is uniform under the null and decreasing under the alternative. We also show that our method asymptotically implements the oracle Bayes procedure for a weighted classification risk, optimally trading off between false positives and false negatives. We derive the limiting distribution of the attained maximum lfdr over the rejections, and the limiting empirical Bayes regret relative to the oracle procedure.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a class of asymptotically most powerful knockoff statistics based on a simple principle: that we should prioritize variables in order of our ability to distinguish them from their knockoffs. Our contribution is threefold. First, we argue that feature statistics should estimate "oracle masked likelihood ratios," which are Neyman-Pearson statistics for discriminating between features and knockoffs using partially observed (masked) data. Second, we introduce the masked likelihood ratio (MLR) statistic, a knockoff statistic that estimates the oracle MLR. We show that MLR statistics are asymptotically average-case optimal, i.e., they maximize the expected number of discoveries made by knockoffs when averaging over a user-specified prior on unknown parameters. Our optimality result places no explicit restrictions on the problem dimensions or the unknown relationship between the response and covariates; instead, we assume a "local dependence" condition which depends only on simple quantities that can be calculated from the data. Third, in simulations and three real data applications, we show that MLR statistics outperform state-of-the-art feature statistics, including in settings where the prior is highly misspecified. We implement MLR statistics in the open-source python package knockpy; our implementation is often (although not always) faster than computing a cross-validated lasso.},

  abstract = {Scientists often must simultaneously localize and discover signals. For instance, in genetic fine-mapping, high correlations between nearby genetic variants make it hard to identify the exact locations of causal variants. So the statistical task is to output as many disjoint regions containing a signal as possible, each as small as possible, while controlling false positives. Similar problems arise in any application where signals cannot be perfectly localized, such as locating stars in astronomical surveys and changepoint detection in sequential data. Common Bayesian approaches to these problems involve computing a posterior distribution over signal locations. However, existing procedures to translate these posteriors into actual credible regions for the signals fail to capture all the information in the posterior, leading to lower power and (sometimes) inflated false discoveries. With this motivation, we introduce Bayesian Linear Programming (BLiP). Given a posterior distribution over signals, BLiP outputs credible regions for signals which verifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives. BLiP overcomes an extremely high-dimensional and nonconvex problem to verifiably nearly maximize expected power while controlling false positives. BLiP is very computationally efficient compared to the cost of computing the posterior and can wrap around nearly any Bayesian model and algorithm. Applying BLiP to existing state-of-the-art analyses of UK Biobank data (for genetic fine-mapping) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (for astronomical point source detection) increased power by 30-120\% in just a few minutes of additional computation. BLiP is implemented in pyblip (Python) and blipr (R).},

  abstract = {BLUP (best linear unbiased prediction) is widely used to predict complex traits in plant and animal breeding, and increasingly in human genetics. The BLUP mathematical model, which consists of a single random effect term, was adequate when kinships were measured from pedigrees. However, when genome-wide SNPs are used to measure kinships, the BLUP model implicitly assumes that all SNPs have the same effect-size distribution, which is a severe and unnecessary limitation. We propose MultiBLUP, which extends the BLUP model to include multiple random effects, allowing greatly improved prediction when the random effects correspond to classes of SNPs with distinct effect-size variances. The SNP classes can be specified in advance, for example, based on SNP functional annotations, and we also provide an adaptive procedure for determining a suitable partition of SNPs. We apply MultiBLUP to genome-wide association data from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (seven diseases), and from much larger studies of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, finding that it consistently provides better prediction than alternative methods. Moreover, MultiBLUP is computationally very efficient; for the largest data set, which includes 12,678 individuals and 1.5 M SNPs, the total analysis can be run on a single desktop PC in less than a day and can be parallelized to run even faster. Tools to perform MultiBLUP are freely available in our software LDAK.},

  abstract = {Sequential quantile estimation refers to incorporating observations into quantile estimates in an incremental fashion thus furnishing an online estimate of one or more quantiles at any given point in time. Sequential quantile estimation is also known as online quantile estimation. This area is relevant to the analysis of data streams and to the one-pass analysis of massive data sets. Applications include network traffic and latency analysis, real time fraud detection and high frequency trading. We introduce new techniques for online quantile estimation based on Hermite series estimators in the settings of static quantile estimation and dynamic quantile estimation. In the static quantile estimation setting we apply the existing Gauss-Hermite expansion in a novel manner. In particular, we exploit the fact that Gauss-Hermite coefficients can be updated in a sequential manner. To treat dynamic quantile estimation we introduce a novel expansion with an exponentially weighted estimator for the Gauss-Hermite coefficients which we term the Exponentially Weighted Gauss-Hermite (EWGH) expansion. These algorithms go beyond existing sequential quantile estimation algorithms in that they allow arbitrary quantiles (as opposed to pre-specified quantiles) to be estimated at any point in time. In doing so we provide a solution to online distribution function and online quantile function estimation on data streams. In particular we derive an analytical expression for the CDF and prove consistency results for the CDF under certain conditions. In addition we analyse the associated quantile estimator. Simulation studies and tests on real data reveal the Gauss-Hermite based algorithms to be competitive with a leading existing algorithm.},

In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so-called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach—we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power. We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini–Hochberg FDR method.},

It  is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are  tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected  to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical  significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false  discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of  true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily  interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the               q               value is associated with each tested feature. The               q               value  is similar to the well known               p               value, except it is a measure of  significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false  positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while  offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for  linkage.},

  abstract = {Summary. The false discovery rate (FDR) is a multiple hypothesis testing quantity that describes the expected proportion of false positive results among all rejected null hypotheses. Benjamini and Hochberg introduced this quantity and proved that a particular step-up p-value method controls the FDR. Storey introduced a point estimate of the FDR for fixed significance regions. The former approach conservatively controls the FDR at a fixed predetermined level, and the latter provides a conservatively biased estimate of the FDR for a fixed predetermined significance region. In this work, we show in both finite sample and asymptotic settings that the goals of the two approaches are essentially equivalent. In particular, the FDR point estimates can be used to define valid FDR controlling procedures. In the asymptotic setting, we also show that the point estimates can be used to estimate the FDR conservatively over all significance regions simultaneously, which is equivalent to controlling the FDR at all levels simultaneously. The main tool that we use is to translate existing FDR methods into procedures involving empirical processes. This simplifies finite sample proofs, provides a framework for asymptotic results and proves that these procedures are valid even under certain forms of dependence.},

In the special case of a scalar function \$f: \textbackslash mathbb\{R\} \textbackslash to \textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\$, our algorithm takes as input a reference point \$x\_0\$, trust region \$[a, b]\$, and integer \$k \textbackslash ge 1\$, and returns an interval \$I\$ such that \$f(x) - \textbackslash sum\_\{i=0\}\^\{k-1\} \textbackslash frac \{1\} \{i!\} f\^\{(i)\}(x\_0) (x - x\_0)\^i \textbackslash in I (x - x\_0)\^k\$ for all \$x \textbackslash in [a, b]\$. As in automatic differentiation, the function \$f\$ is provided to the algorithm in symbolic form, and must be composed of known atomic functions. At a high level, our algorithm has two steps. First, for a variety of commonly-used elementary functions (e.g., \$\textbackslash exp\$, \$\textbackslash log\$), we use recently-developed theory to derive sharp polynomial upper and lower bounds on the Taylor remainder series. We then recursively combine the bounds for the elementary functions using an interval arithmetic variant of Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Our algorithm can make efficient use of machine learning hardware accelerators, and we provide an open source implementation in JAX. We then turn our attention to applications. Most notably, in a companion paper we use our new machinery to create the first universal majorization-minimization optimization algorithms: algorithms that iteratively minimize an arbitrary loss using a majorizer that is derived automatically, rather than by hand. We also show that our automatically-derived bounds can be used for verified global optimization and numerical integration, and to prove sharper versions of Jensen's inequality.},

We also found nonlinear dynamic eQTLs, which affect only intermediate stages of differentiation, and cannot be found by using data from mature tissues. These fleeting genetic associations with gene regulation may represent a new mechanism to explain complex traits and disease.

The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common.

We present comprehensive protein quantitative trait locus (pQTL) mapping of 2,923 proteins that identifies 14,287 primary genetic associations, of which 81\% are previously undescribed, alongside ancestry-specific pQTL mapping in non-European individuals. The study provides an updated characterization of the genetic architecture of the plasma proteome, contextualized with projected pQTL discovery rates as sample sizes and proteomic assay coverages increase over time. We offer extensive insights into trans pQTLs across multiple biological domains, highlight genetic influences on ligand–receptor interactions and pathway perturbations across a diverse collection of cytokines and complement networks, and illustrate long-range epistatic effects of ABO blood group and FUT2 secretor status on proteins with gastrointestinal tissue-enriched expression. We demonstrate the utility of these data for drug discovery by extending the genetic proxied effects of protein targets, such as PCSK9, on additional endpoints, and disentangle specific genes and proteins perturbed at loci associated with COVID-19 susceptibility.

  abstract = {A pressing challenge in single-cell transcriptomics is to benchmark experimental protocols and computational methods. A solution is to use computational simulators, but existing simulators cannot simultaneously achieve three goals: preserving genes, capturing gene correlations, and generating any number of cells with varying sequencing depths. To fill this gap, we propose scDesign2, a transparent simulator that achieves all three goals and generates high-fidelity synthetic data for multiple single-cell gene expression count-based technologies. In particular, scDesign2 is advantageous in its transparent use of probabilistic models and its ability to capture gene correlations via copulas.},

  abstract = {Every student in statistics or data science learns early on that when the sample size largely exceeds the number of variables, fitting a logistic model produces estimates that are approximately unbiased. Every student also learns that there are formulas to predict the variability of these estimates which are used for the purpose of statistical inference; for instance, to produce p-values for testing the significance of regression coefficients. Although these formulas come from large sample asymptotics, we are often told that we are on reasonably safe grounds when \$n\$ is large in such a way that \$n \textbackslash ge 5p\$ or \$n \textbackslash ge 10p\$. This paper shows that this is far from the case, and consequently, inferences routinely produced by common software packages are often unreliable. Consider a logistic model with independent features in which \$n\$ and \$p\$ become increasingly large in a fixed ratio. Then we show that (1) the MLE is biased, (2) the variability of the MLE is far greater than classically predicted, and (3) the commonly used likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is not distributed as a chi-square. The bias of the MLE is extremely problematic as it yields completely wrong predictions for the probability of a case based on observed values of the covariates. We develop a new theory, which asymptotically predicts (1) the bias of the MLE, (2) the variability of the MLE, and (3) the distribution of the LRT. We empirically also demonstrate that these predictions are extremely accurate in finite samples. Further, an appealing feature is that these novel predictions depend on the unknown sequence of regression coefficients only through a single scalar, the overall strength of the signal. This suggests very concrete procedures to adjust inference; we describe one such procedure learning a single parameter from data and producing accurate inference},

We are often told that these calculations are approximately valid if we have 5 to 10 observations per unknown parameter. This paper shows that this is far from the case, and consequently, inferences produced by common software packages are often unreliable. Consider a logistic model with independent features in which n and p become increasingly large in a fixed ratio. We prove that (i) the maximum-likelihood estimate (MLE) is biased, (ii) the variability of the MLE is far greater than classically estimated, and (iii) the likelihood-ratio test (LRT) is not distributed as a χ2. The bias of the MLE yields wrong predictions for the probability of a case based on observed values of the covariates. We present a theory, which provides explicit expressions for the asymptotic bias and variance of the MLE and the asymptotic distribution of the LRT. We empirically demonstrate that these results are accurate in finite samples. Our results depend only on a single measure of signal strength, which leads to concrete proposals for obtaining accurate inference in finite samples through the estimate of this measure.},

  abstract = {In recent work, Wang et al introduced the “Sum of Single Effects” (SuSiE) model, and showed that it provides a simple and efficient approach to fine-mapping genetic variants from individual-level data. Here we present new methods for fitting the SuSiE model to summary data, for example to single-SNP z-scores from an association study and linkage disequilibrium (LD) values estimated from a suitable reference panel. To develop these new methods, we first describe a simple, generic strategy for extending any individual-level data method to deal with summary data. The key idea is to replace the usual regression likelihood with an analogous likelihood based on summary data. We show that existing fine-mapping methods such as FINEMAP and CAVIAR also (implicitly) use this strategy, but in different ways, and so this provides a common framework for understanding different methods for fine-mapping. We investigate other common practical issues in fine-mapping with summary data, including problems caused by inconsistencies between the z-scores and LD estimates, and we develop diagnostics to identify these inconsistencies. We also present a new refinement procedure that improves model fits in some data sets, and hence improves overall reliability of the SuSiE fine-mapping results. Detailed evaluations of fine-mapping methods in a range of simulated data sets show that SuSiE applied to summary data is competitive, in both speed and accuracy, with the best available fine-mapping methods for summary data.},

  abstract = {A defining feature of cellular growth is that protein and mRNA amounts scale with cell size so that concentrations remain approximately constant, thereby ensuring similar reaction rates and efficient biosynthesis. A key component of this biosynthetic scaling is the scaling of mRNA amounts with cell size, which occurs even among cells with the same DNA template copy number. Here, we identify RNA polymerase II as a major limiting factor increasing transcription with cell size. Other components of the transcriptional machinery are only minimally limiting and the chromatin environment is largely invariant with size. However, RNA polymerase II activity does not increase in direct proportion to cell size, inconsistent with previously proposed DNA-titration models. Instead, our data support a dynamic equilibrium model where the rate of polymerase loading is proportional to the unengaged nucleoplasmic polymerase concentration. This sublinear transcriptional increase is then balanced by a compensatory increase in mRNA stability as cells get larger. Taken together, our results show how limiting RNA polymerase II and feedback on mRNA stability work in concert to ensure the precise scaling of mRNA amounts across the physiological cell size range.},

The frequent feedbacks and the natural evolution of genomics and bioinformatics have allowed the growth of the tool and the development of this third release. In this version, a special effort has been made to remove noisy and redundant output from the enrichment results with the inclusion of a recently reported algorithm that summarizes significantly enriched terms and generates functionally coherent modules of genes and terms. A new comparative analysis has been added to allow the differential analysis of gene sets. To expand the scope of the application, new sources of biological information have been included, such as genetic diseases, drugs–genes interactions and Pubmed information among others. Finally, the graphic section has been renewed with the inclusion of new interactive graphics and filtering options. The application is freely available at http://genecodis.cnb.csic.es.},

In this article, we develop double empirical Bayes testing (DEBT), an empirical Bayes method for analysing multiexperiment studies when many covariates are gathered per experiment. DEBT is a two-stage method: in the first stage, it reports which experiments yielded significant outcomes and in the second stage, it hypothesises which covariates drive the experimental significance. In both of its stages, DEBT builds on the work of Efron, who laid out an elegant empirical Bayes approach to testing. DEBT enhances this framework by learning a series of black box predictive models to boost power and control the false discovery rate. In Stage 1, it uses a deep neural network prior to report which experiments yielded significant outcomes. In Stage 2, it uses an empirical Bayes version of the knockoff filter to select covariates that have significant predictive power of Stage 1 significance. In both simulated and real data, DEBT increases the proportion of discovered significant outcomes and selects more features when signals are weak. In a real study of cancer cell lines, DEBT selects a robust set of biologically plausible genomic drivers of drug sensitivity and resistance in cancer.},

FDR smoothing automatically finds spatially localized regions of significant test statistics. It then relaxes the threshold of statistical significance within these regions, and tightens it elsewhere, in a manner that controls the overall false discovery rate at a given level. This results in increased power and cleaner spatial separation of signals from noise. The approach requires solving a nonstandard high-dimensional optimization problem, for which an efficient augmented-Lagrangian algorithm is presented. In simulation studies, FDR smoothing exhibits state-of-the-art performance at modest computational cost. In particular, it is shown to be far more robust than existing methods for spatially dependent multiple testing. We also apply the method to a dataset from an fMRI experiment on spatial working memory, where it detects patterns that are much more biologically plausible than those detected by standard FDR-controlling methods. All code for FDR smoothing is publicly available in Python and R (https://github.com/tansey/smoothfdr). Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We further extend the reach of the elastic net-regularized regression to all generalized linear model families, Cox models with (start, stop] data and strata, and a simplified version of the relaxed lasso. We also discuss convenient utility functions for measuring the performance of these fitted models.},

We find hundreds of genes and DNAme sites associated with fasting insulin, waist, and body mass index, as well as thousands of DNAme sites associated with gene expression (eQTM). We find that controlling for heterogeneity in tissue/muscle fiber type reduces the number of physiological trait associations, and that long-range eQTMs ({$>$}1 Mb) are reduced when controlling for tissue/muscle fiber type or latent factors. We map genetic regulators (quantitative trait loci; QTLs) of expression (eQTLs) and DNAme (mQTLs). Using Mendelian randomization (MR) and mediation techniques, we leverage these genetic maps to predict 213 causal relationships between expression and DNAme, approximately two-thirds of which predict methylation to causally influence expression. We use MR to integrate FUSION mQTLs, FUSION eQTLs, and GTEx eQTLs for 48 tissues with genetic associations for 534 diseases and quantitative traits. We identify hundreds of genes and thousands of DNAme sites that may drive the reported disease/quantitative trait genetic associations. We identify 300 gene expression MR associations that are present in both FUSION and GTEx skeletal muscle and that show stronger evidence of MR association in skeletal muscle than other tissues, which may partially reflect differences in power across tissues. As one example, we find that increased RXRA muscle expression may decrease lean tissue mass.},

  abstract = {The complex nature of artificial neural networks raises concerns on their reliability, trustworthiness, and fairness in real-world scenarios. The Shapley value -- a solution concept from game theory -- is one of the most popular explanation methods for machine learning models. More traditionally, from the perspective of statistical learning, feature importance is defined in terms of conditional independence. So far, these two approaches to interpretability and feature importance have been considered separate and distinct. In this work, we show that Shapley-based explanation methods and conditional independence testing are closely related. We introduce the \$\textbackslash textbf\{SHAP\}\$ley \$\textbackslash textbf\{L\}\$ocal \$\textbackslash textbf\{I\}\$ndependence \$\textbackslash textbf\{T\}\$est (\$\textbackslash textbf\{SHAPLIT\}\$), a novel testing procedure inspired by the Conditional Randomization Test (CRT) for a specific notion of local (i.e., on a sample) conditional independence. With it, we prove that for binary classification problems, each marginal contribution in the Shapley value is an upper bound to the \$p\$-value of this conditional independence test. Furthermore, we show that the Shapley value itself provides an upper bound to the \$p\$-value of a global SHAPLIT null hypothesis. As a result, we grant the Shapley value with a precise statistical sense of importance with false positive rate control.},

We couple this choice with the use of joint credible sets to avoid performing a search over the high-dimensional model space. The approach is shown to outperform other methods in high-dimensional settings, especially with highly correlated data.

El Ghaoui and his colleagues have proposed ‘SAFE’ rules, based on univariate inner products between each predictor and the outcome, which guarantee that a coefficient will be 0 in the solution vector. This provides a reduction in the number of variables that need to be entered into the optimization. We propose strong rules that are very simple and yet screen out far more predictors than the SAFE rules. This great practical improvement comes at a price: the strong rules are not foolproof and can mistakenly discard active predictors, i.e. predictors that have non-zero coefficients in the solution.We therefore combine them with simple checks of the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions to ensure that the exact solution to the convex problem is delivered. Of course, any (approximate) screening method can be combined with the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions to ensure the exact solution; the strength of the strong rules lies in the fact that, in practice, they discard a very large number of the inactive predictors and almost never commit mistakes. We also derive conditions under which they are foolproof. Strong rules provide substantial savings in computational time for a variety of statistical optimization problems.},

However, softmax estimation is very expensive for large scale inference because of the high cost associated with computing the normalizing constant. Here, we introduce an efficient approximation to softmax probabilities which takes the form of a rigorous lower bound on the exact probability. This bound is expressed as a product over pairwise probabilities and it leads to scalable estimation based on stochastic optimization. It allows us to perform doubly stochastic estimation by subsampling both training instances and class labels. We show that the new bound has interesting theoretical properties and we demonstrate its use in classification problems.},

The conventional practice first reduces the original observations to a vector of p-values and then chooses a cutoff to adjust for multiplicity. However, this data reduction step could cause significant loss of information and thus lead to suboptimal testing procedures. We introduce a new framework for two-sample multiple testing by incorporating a carefully constructed auxiliary variable in inference to improve the power. A data-driven multiple-testing procedure is developed by employing a covariate-assisted ranking and screening (CARS) approach that optimally combines the information from both the primary and the auxiliary variables. The proposed CARS procedure is shown to be asymptotically valid and optimal for false discovery rate control. The procedure is implemented in the R package CARS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of CARS in false discovery rate control and show that it achieves substantial power gain over existing methods. CARS is also illustrated through an application to the analysis of a satellite imaging data set for supernova detection.},

As a result, the practice of utilizing the DNA of an individual to predict disease has been judged to provide little to no useful information.

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are widely used for the analysis of spatial data due to their nonparametric flexibility and ability to quantify uncertainty, and recently developed scalable approximations have facilitated application to massive datasets. For multivariate outcomes, linear models of coregionalization combine dimension reduction with spatial correlation. However, their real-valued latent factors and loadings are difficult to interpret because, unlike nonnegative models, they do not recover a parts-based representation. We present nonnegative spatial factorization (NSF), a spatially-aware probabilistic dimension reduction model that naturally encourages sparsity. We compare NSF to real-valued spatial factorizations such as MEFISTO (Velten et al., 2020) and nonspatial dimension reduction methods using simulations and high-dimensional spatial transcriptomics data. NSF identifies generalizable spatial patterns of gene expression. Since not all patterns of gene expression are spatial, we also propose a hybrid extension of NSF that combines spatial and nonspatial components, enabling quantification of spatial importance for both observations and features. A TensorFlow implementation of NSF is available from https://github.com/willtownes/nsf-paper.},

With stochastic optimization, inference on the augmented distribution is scalable. Furthermore, our strategy is generic: it can be applied to any inference procedure that currently uses the mean-field or structured approach. Copula variational inference has many advantages: it reduces bias; it is less sensitive to local optima; it is less sensitive to hyperparameters; and it helps characterize and interpret the dependency among the latent variables.},

Our main result is to demonstrate that some of the most frequently used gene set methods, GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE, are severely influenced by the filtering of the data in a way that such an analysis is no longer reconcilable with the principles of statistical inference, rendering the obtained results in the worst case inexpressive. A possible consequence of this is that these methods can increase their power by the addition of unrelated data and noise. Our results are obtained within a bootstrapping framework that allows a rigorous assessment of the robustness of results and enables power estimates. Our results indicate that when using competitive gene set methods, it is imperative to apply a stringent gene filtering criterion. However, even when genes are filtered appropriately, for gene expression data from chips that do not provide a genome-scale coverage of the expression values of all mRNAs, this is not enough for GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE to ensure the statistical soundness of the applied procedure. For this reason, for biomedical and clinical studies, we strongly advice not to use GSEA, GSEArot and GAGE for such data sets.},

While standard practice is to model regression parameters (effects) as (1) exchangeable across the groups and (2) correlated to differing degrees across covariates, we show that this approach exhibits poor statistical performance when the number of covariates exceeds the number of groups. For instance, in statistical genetics, we might regress dozens of traits (defining groups) for thousands of individuals (responses) on up to millions of genetic variants (covariates). When an analyst has more covariates than groups, we argue that it is often preferable to instead model effects as (1) exchangeable across covariates and (2) correlated to differing degrees across groups. To this end, we propose a hierarchical model expressing our alternative perspective. We devise an empirical Bayes estimator for learning the degree of correlation between groups. We develop theory that demonstrates that our method outperforms the classic approach when the number of covariates dominates the number of groups, and corroborate this result empirically on several high-dimensional multiple regression and classification problems.},

Although many studies have identified non-coding functional annotations that overlap disease-associated variants, these annotations often colocalize, complicating the ability to use these annotations for fine mapping causal variation. We developed a statistical approach (Genomic Annotation Shifter [GoShifter]) to assess whether enriched annotations are able to prioritize causal variation. GoShifter defines the null distribution of an annotation overlapping an allele by locally shifting annotations; this approach is less sensitive to biases arising from local genomic structure than commonly used enrichment methods that depend on SNP matching. Local shifting also allows GoShifter to identify independent causal effects from colocalizing annotations. Using GoShifter, we confirmed that variants in expression quantitative trail loci drive gene-expression changes though DNase-I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) near transcription start sites and independently through 3′ UTR regulation. We also showed that (1) 15\%–36\% of trait-associated loci map to DHSs independently of other annotations; (2) loci associated with breast cancer and rheumatoid arthritis harbor potentially causal variants near the summits of histone marks rather than full peak bodies; (3) variants associated with height are highly enriched in embryonic stem cell DHSs; and (4) we can effectively prioritize causal variation at specific loci.},

  abstract = {Low-rank matrix approximation is one of the central concepts in machine learning, with applications in dimension reduction, de-noising, multivariate statistical methodology, and many more. A recent extension to LRMA is called low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). It solves the LRMA problem when some observations are missing and is especially useful for recommender systems. In this paper, we consider an element-wise weighted generalization of LRMA. The resulting weighted low-rank matrix approximation technique therefore covers LRMC as a special case with binary weights. WLRMA has many applications. For example, it is an essential component of GLM optimization algorithms, where an exponential family is used to model the entries of a matrix, and the matrix of natural parameters admits a low-rank structure. We propose an algorithm for solving the weighted problem, as well as two acceleration techniques. Further, we develop a non-SVD modification of the proposed algorithm that is able to handle extremely high-dimensional data. We compare the performance of all the methods on a small simulation example as well as a real-data application.},

While there is a vast literature on how to exploit low rank structure in these datasets, there is less attention paid to explaining why the low rank structure appears in the first place. Here, we explain the effectiveness of low rank models in data science by considering a simple generative model for these matrices: we suppose that each row or column is associated to a (possibly high dimensional) bounded latent variable, and entries of the matrix are generated by applying a piecewise analytic function to these latent variables. These matrices are in general full rank. However, we show that we can approximate every entry of an m \textbackslash times  n matrix drawn from this model to within a fixed absolute error by a low rank matrix whose rank grows as \textbackslash scrO (log(m + n)). Hence any sufficiently large matrix from such a latent variable model can be approximated, up to a small entrywise error, by a low rank matrix.},

We assess whether the genetic determinants of blood lipids, a major cardiovascular risk factor, are shared across populations. Genetic correlations for lipids between European-ancestry and Asian cohorts are not significantly different from 1. A genetic risk score based on LDL-cholesterol-associated loci has consistent effects on serum levels in samples from the UK, Uganda and Greece (               r               \,=\,0.23–0.28,               p               \,{$<$}\,1.9\,×\,10               −14               ). Overall, there is evidence of reproducibility for \textasciitilde 75\% of the major lipid loci from European discovery studies, except triglyceride loci in the Ugandan samples (10\% of loci). Individual transferable loci are identified using trans-ethnic colocalization. Ten of fourteen loci not transferable to the Ugandan population have pleiotropic associations with BMI in Europeans; none of the transferable loci do. The non-transferable loci might affect lipids by modifying food intake in environments rich in certain nutrients, which suggests a potential role for gene-environment interactions.},

Penalized regression overcomes this non-identifiability by augmentation of the loss function by a penalty (i.e. a function of regression coefficients). The ridge penalty is the sum of squared regression coefficients, giving rise to ridge regression. Here many aspect of ridge regression are reviewed e.g. moments, mean squared error, its equivalence to constrained estimation, and its relation to Bayesian regression. Finally, its behaviour and use are illustrated in simulation and on omics data. Subsequently, ridge regression is generalized to allow for a more general penalty. The ridge penalization framework is then translated to logistic regression and its properties are shown to carry over. To contrast ridge penalized estimation, the final chapters introduce its lasso counterpart and generalizations thereof.},

In this article, we consider Gaussian latent variable models where the integration over the latent values is approximated using the Laplace method or expectation propagation (EP). We study the properties of several Bayesian leave-one-out (LOO) crossvalidation approximations that in most cases can be computed with a small additional cost after forming the posterior approximation given the full data. Our main objective is to assess the accuracy of the approximative LOO cross-validation estimators. That is, for each method (Laplace and EP) we compare the approximate fast computation with the exact brute force LOO computation. Secondarily, we evaluate the accuracy of the Laplace and EP approximations themselves against a ground truth established through extensive Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Our empirical results show that the approach based upon a Gaussian approximation to the LOO marginal distribution (the so-called cavity distribution) gives the most accurate and reliable results among the fast methods.},

  abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {Recent studies of the HapMap lymphoblastoid cell lines have identified large numbers of quantitative trait loci for gene expression (eQTLs). Reanalyzing these data using a novel Bayesian hierarchical model, we were able to create a surprisingly high-resolution map of the typical locations of sites that affect mRNA levels in cis. Strikingly, we found a strong enrichment of eQTLs in the 250 bp just upstream of the transcription end site (TES), in addition to an enrichment around the transcription start site (TSS). Most eQTLs lie either within genes or close to genes; for example, we estimate that only 5\% of eQTLs lie more than 20 kb upstream of the TSS. After controlling for position effects, SNPs in exons are ∼2-fold more likely than SNPs in introns to be eQTLs. Our results suggest an important role for mRNA stability in determining steady-state mRNA levels, and highlight the potential of eQTL mapping as a high-resolution tool for studying the determinants of gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have highlighted that almost any trait is affected by many variants of relatively small effect. On one hand this presents a challenge for inferring the effect of any single variant as the signal-to-noise ratio is high for variants of small effect. This challenge is compounded when combining information across many variants in polygenic scores for predicting trait values. On the other hand, the large number of contributing variants provides an opportunity to learn about the average behavior of variants encoded in the distribution of variant effect sizes. Many approaches have looked at aspects of this problem, but no method has unified the inference of the effects of individual variants with the inference of the distribution of effect sizes while requiring only GWAS summary statistics and properly accounting for linkage disequilibrium between variants. Here we present a flexible, unifying framework that combines information across variants to infer a distribution of effect sizes and uses this distribution to improve the estimation of the effects of individual variants. We also develop a variational inference (VI) scheme to perform efficient inference under this framework. We show this framework is useful by constructing polygenic scores (PGSs) that outperform the state-of-the-art. Our modeling framework easily extends to jointly inferring effect sizes across multiple cohorts, where we show that building PGSs using additional cohorts of differing ancestries improves predictive accuracy and portability. We also investigate the inferred distributions of effect sizes across many traits and find that these distributions have effect sizes ranging over multiple orders of magnitude, in contrast to the assumptions implicit in many commonly-used statistical genetics methods.},

  abstract = {Unparalleled technological advances have fueled an explosive growth in the scope and scale of biological data and have propelled life sciences into the realm of “Big Data” that cannot be managed or analyzed by conventional approaches. Big Data in the life sciences are driven primarily via a diverse collection of ‘omics’-based technologies, including genomics, proteomics, metabolomics, transcriptomics, metagenomics, and lipidomics. Gene-set enrichment analysis is a powerful approach for interrogating large ‘omics’ datasets, leading to the identification of biological mechanisms associated with observed outcomes. While several factors influence the results from such analysis, the impact from the contents of pathway databases is often under-appreciated. Pathway databases often contain variously named pathways that overlap with one another to varying degrees. Ignoring such redundancies during pathway analysis can lead to the designation of several pathways as being significant due to high content-similarity, rather than truly independent biological mechanisms. Statistically, such dependencies also result in correlated p values and overdispersion, leading to biased results. We investigated the level of redundancies in multiple pathway databases and observed large discrepancies in the nature and extent of pathway overlap. This prompted us to develop the application, ReCiPa (Redundancy Control in Pathway Databases), to control redundancies in pathway databases based on user-defined thresholds. Analysis of genomic and genetic datasets, using ReCiPa-generated overlap-controlled versions of KEGG and Reactome pathways, led to a reduction in redundancy among the top-scoring gene-sets and allowed for the inclusion of additional gene-sets representing possibly novel biological mechanisms. Using obesity as an example, bioinformatic analysis further demonstrated that gene-sets identified from overlap-controlled pathway databases show stronger evidence of prior association to obesity compared to pathways identified from the original databases.},

  abstract = {The identification of signals of very recent positive selection provides information about the adaptation of modern humans to local conditions. We report here on a genome-wide scan for signals of very recent positive selection in favor of variants that have not yet reached fixation. We describe a new analytical method for scanning single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for signals of recent selection, and apply this to data from the International HapMap Project. In all three continental groups we find widespread signals of recent positive selection. Most signals are region-specific, though a significant excess are shared across groups. Contrary to some earlier low resolution studies that suggested a paucity of recent selection in sub-Saharan Africans, we find that by some measures our strongest signals of selection are from the Yoruba population. Finally, since these signals indicate the existence of genetic variants that have substantially different fitnesses, they must indicate loci that are the source of significant phenotypic variation. Though the relevant phenotypes are generally not known, such loci should be of particular interest in mapping studies of complex traits. For this purpose we have developed a set of SNPs that can be used to tag the strongest ∼250 signals of recent selection in each population.},

To investigate the genetics of gene expression, we performed cis- and trans-expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses using blood-derived expression from 31,684 individuals through the eQTLGen Consortium. We detected cis-eQTL for 88\% of genes, and these were replicable in numerous tissues. Distal trans-eQTL (detected for 37\% of 10,317 trait-associated variants tested) showed lower replication rates, partially due to low replication power and confounding by cell type composition. However, replication analyses in single-cell RNA-seq data prioritized intracellular trans-eQTL. Trans-eQTL exerted their effects via several mechanisms, primarily through regulation by transcription factors. Expression of 13\% of the genes correlated with polygenic scores for 1,263 phenotypes, pinpointing potential drivers for those traits. In summary, this work represents a large eQTL resource, and its results serve as a starting point for in-depth interpretation of complex phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Methods of merging several p-values into a single p-value are important in their own right and widely used in multiple hypothesis testing. This paper is the first to systematically study the admissibility (in Wald's sense) of p-merging functions and their domination structure, without any information on the dependence structure of the input p-values. As a technical tool we use the notion of e-values, which are alternatives to p-values recently promoted by several authors. We obtain several results on the representation of admissible p-merging functions via e-values and on (in)admissibility of existing p-merging functions. By introducing new admissible p-merging functions, we show that some classic merging methods can be strictly improved to enhance power without compromising validity under arbitrary dependence.},

This paper is concerned with the problem of testing the exchangeability assumption in the on-line mode: examples are observed one by one and the goal is to monitor on-line the strength of evidence against the hypothesis of exchangeability. We introduce the notion of exchangeability martingales, which are online procedures for detecting deviations from exchangeability; in essence, they are betting schemes that never risk bankruptcy and are fair under the hypothesis of exchangeability. Some specific exchangeability martingales are constructed using Transductive Confidence Machine. We report experimental results showing their performance on the USPS benchmark data set of hand-written digits (known to be somewhat heterogeneous); one of them multiplies the initial capital by more than 1018; this means that the hypothesis of exchangeability is rejected at the significance level 10−18.},

We explore risk loci where TWAS accurately prioritizes the likely causal gene as well as loci where TWAS prioritizes multiple genes, some likely to be non-causal, owing to sharing of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL). TWAS is especially prone to spurious prioritization with expression data from non-trait-related tissues or cell types, owing to substantial cross-cell-type variation in expression levels and eQTL strengths. Nonetheless, TWAS prioritizes candidate causal genes more accurately than simple baselines. We suggest best practices for causal-gene prioritization with TWAS and discuss future opportunities for improvement. Our results showcase the strengths and limitations of using eQTL datasets to determine causal genes at GWAS loci.},

We introduce a new class of upper bounds on the log partition function, based on convex combinations of distributions in the exponential domain, that is applicable to an arbitrary undirected graphical model. In the special case of convex combinations of tree-structured distributions, we obtain a family of variational problems, similar to the Bethe free energy, but distinguished by the following desirable properties: i. they are cnvex, and have a unique global minimum; and ii. the global minimum gives an upper bound on the log partition function. The global minimum is defined by stationary conditions very similar to those defining fixed points of belief propagation or tree-based reparameterization Wainwright et al., 2001. As with BP fixed points, the elements of the minimizing argument can be used as approximations to the marginals of the original model. The analysis described here can be extended to structures of higher treewidth e.g., hypertrees, thereby making connections with more advanced approximations e.g., Kikuchi and variants Yedidia et al., 2001; Minka, 2001.},

  abstract = {(abridged) We develop an algorithm for estimating parameters of a distribution sampled with contamination, employing a statistical technique known as ``expectation maximization'' (EM). Given models for both member and contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples are presented in a companion paper and contain discrete measurements of line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and Mg index for \textasciitilde 1000 - 2500 stars per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The EM algorithm quantifies both dSph and contaminant distributions, returning maximum-likelihood estimates of the means and variances, as well as the probability that each star is a dSph member. Applied to our MMFS data, the EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 probable dSph members. We test the performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples ranging from large (N \textasciitilde 3000) to small (N\textasciitilde 30), the EM algorithm distinguishes members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma clipping).},

  abstract = {Horizontal integration of summary statistics from different GWAS traits can be used to evaluate evidence for their shared genetic causality. One popular method to do this is a Bayesian method, coloc, which is attractive in requiring only GWAS summary statistics and no linkage disequilibrium estimates and is now being used routinely to perform thousands of comparisons between traits. Here we show that while most users do not adjust default software values, misspecification of prior parameters can substantially alter posterior inference. We suggest data driven methods to derive sensible prior values, and demonstrate how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess robustness of posterior inference. The flexibility of coloc comes at the expense of an unrealistic assumption of a single causal variant per trait. This assumption can be relaxed by stepwise conditioning, but this requires external software and an LD matrix aligned to study alleles. We have now implemented conditioning within coloc, and propose a new alternative method, masking, that does not require LD and approximates conditioning when causal variants are independent. Importantly, masking can be used in combination with conditioning where allelically aligned LD estimates are available for only a single trait. We have implemented these developments in a new version of coloc which we hope will enable more informed choice of priors and overcome the restriction of the single causal variant assumptions in coloc analysis.},

  abstract = {This paper concerns the control of text-guided generative models, where a user provides a natural language prompt and the model generates samples based on this input. Prompting is intuitive, general, and flexible. However, there are significant limitations: prompting can fail in surprising ways, and it is often unclear how to find a prompt that will elicit some desired target behavior. A core difficulty for developing methods to overcome these issues is that failures are know-it-when-you-see-it -- it's hard to fix bugs if you can't state precisely what the model should have done! In this paper, we introduce a formalization of "what the user intended" in terms of latent concepts implicit to the data generating process that the model was trained on. This formalization allows us to identify some fundamental limitations of prompting. We then use the formalism to develop concept algebra to overcome these limitations. Concept algebra is a way of directly manipulating the concepts expressed in the output through algebraic operations on a suitably defined representation of input prompts. We give examples using concept algebra to overcome limitations of prompting, including concept transfer through arithmetic, and concept nullification through projection.

  abstract = {Similarities between parents and offspring arise from nature and nurture. Beyond this simple dichotomy, recent genomic studies have uncovered ‘‘genetic nurture’’ effects, whereby parental genotypes influence offspring outcomes via environmental pathways rather than genetic transmission. Such genetic nurture effects also need to be accounted for to accurately estimate ‘‘direct’’ genetic effects (i.e., genetic effects on a trait originating in the offspring). Empirical studies have indicated that genetic nurture effects are particularly relevant to the intergenerational transmission of risk for child educational outcomes, which are, in turn, associated with major psychological and health milestones throughout the life course. These findings have yet to be systematically appraised across contexts. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify genetic nurture effects on educational outcomes. A total of 12 studies comprising 38,654 distinct parent(s)-offspring pairs or trios from 8 cohorts reported 22 estimates of genetic nurture effects. Genetic nurture effects on offspring’s educational outcomes (bgenetic nurture ¼ 0.08, 95\% CI [0.07, 0.09]) were smaller than direct genetic effects (bdirect genetic ¼ 0.17, 95\% CI [0.13, 0.20]). Findings were largely consistent across studies. Genetic nurture effects originating from mothers and fathers were of similar magnitude, highlighting the need for a greater inclusion of fathers in educational research. Genetic nurture effects were largely explained by observed parental education and socioeconomic status, pointing to their role in environmental pathways shaping child educational outcomes. Findings provide consistent evidence that environmentally mediated parental genetic influences contribute to the intergenerational transmission of educational outcomes, in addition to effects due to genetic transmission.},

  author = {Wang, Gao and Sarkar, Abhishek and Carbonetto, Peter and Stephens, Matthew},
  pages = {41},
  abstract = {We introduce a simple new approach to variable selection in linear regression, and to quantifying uncertainty in selected variables. The approach is based on a new model – the “Sum of Single Effects” (SuSiE) model – which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of “single-effect” vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure – Iterative Bayesian Stepwise Selection (IBSS) – which is a Bayesian analogue of traditional stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods, but instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We show that the IBSS algorithm computes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under the SuSiE model. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally leads to a convenient, novel, way to summarize uncertainty in variable selection, and provides a Credible Set for each selected variable. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and true effects are very sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine-mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and illustrate the methods by fine-mapping genetic variants that influence alternative splicing in human cell-lines. We also discuss both the potential and the challenges for applying these methods to generic variable selection problems.},

To date, most GWAS have been conducted in populations of European ancestry, which limits the use of GWAS-derived PGS in non-European ancestry populations. Here, we derive a theoretical model of the relative accuracy (RA) of PGS across ancestries. We show through extensive simulations that the RA of PGS based on genome-wide significant SNPs can be predicted accurately from modelling linkage disequilibrium (LD), minor allele frequencies (MAF), cross-population correlations of causal SNP effects and heritability. We find that LD and MAF differences between ancestries can explain between 70 and 80\% of the loss of RA of European-based PGS in African ancestry for traits like body mass index and type 2 diabetes. Our results suggest that causal variants underlying common genetic variation identified in European ancestry GWAS are mostly shared across continents.},

In a typical application, mean-field methods approximately compute the posterior with a coordinate-ascent optimization algorithm. When the model is conditionally conjugate, the coordinate updates are easily derived and in closed form. However, many models of interest—like the correlated topic model and Bayesian logistic regression—are nonconjugate. In these models, mean-field methods cannot be directly applied and practitioners have had to develop variational algorithms on a case-by-case basis. In this paper, we develop two generic methods for nonconjugate models, Laplace variational inference and delta method variational inference. Our methods have several advantages: they allow for easily derived variational algorithms with a wide class of nonconjugate models; they extend and unify some of the existing algorithms that have been derived for specific models; and they work well on real-world data sets. We studied our methods on the correlated topic model, Bayesian logistic regression, and hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression.},

Under broad assumptions, as counts get smaller, it is shown that the variance becomes proportional to the mean under monotonic transformations that satisfy , excepting a few pathological cases. A suggested rule-of-thumb is that if many predicted counts are less than one then data transformation cannot reasonably be expected to stabilize variances, even for a well-chosen transformation. This result has clear implications for the analysis of counts as often implemented in the applied sciences, but particularly for multivariate analysis in ecology. Multivariate discrete data are often collected in ecology, typically with a large proportion of zeros, and it is currently widespread to use methods of analysis that do not account for differences in variance across observations nor across responses. Simulations demonstrate that failure to account for the mean–variance relationship can have particularly severe consequences in this context, and also in the univariate context if the sampling design is unbalanced.},

  abstract = {The standard methods for detecting differential gene expression are mostly designed for analyzing a single gene expression experiment. When data from multiple related gene expression studies are available, separately analyzing each study is not ideal as it may fail to detect important genes with consistent but relatively weak differential signals in multiple studies. Jointly modeling all data allows one to borrow information across studies to improve the analysis. However, a simple concordance model, in which each gene is assumed to be differential in either all studies or none of the studies, is incapable of handling genes with study-specific differential expression. In contrast, a model that naively enumerates and analyzes all possible differential patterns across studies can deal with study-specificity and allow information pooling, but the complexity of its parameter space grows exponentially as the number of studies increases. Here, we propose a correlation motif approach to address this dilemma. This approach searches for a small number of latent probability vectors called correlation motifs to capture the major correlation patterns among multiple studies. The motifs provide the basis for sharing information among studies and genes. The approach has flexibility to handle all possible study-specific differential patterns. It improves detection of differential expression and overcomes the barrier of exponential model complexity.},

However, it is often unclear if the extent of context dependency, or Gene-by-Environment interaction (GxE), merits more involved models than the additive model typically used to analyze data from genomewide association studies (GWAS). Here, we derive governing principles for when modeling GxE in GWAS is useful. We derive a decision rule for choosing between competing models for the estimation of allelic effects. The rule weighs the increased noise of context-specific effect estimation against the potential bias when context dependency is ignored. In human GWAS, the increased noise of context-specific estimation often outweighs the bias reduction, rendering GxE models less useful when variants are considered independently. However, for complex traits, considering patterns of context dependency across many variants jointly can substantially improve estimation and trait prediction. Finally, we demonstrate via example that considering polygenic trends of GxE may also be important for interpretation, as analyses based on independently ascertained “top hits” alone can be misleading.},

By taking a different approach that treats the known variances as part of the random observations, we restore symmetry and thus the effectiveness of such methods. We suggest a group-linear empirical Bayes estimator, which collects observations with similar variances and applies a spherically symmetric estimator to each group separately. The proposed estimator is motivated by a new oracle rule which is stronger than the best linear rule, and thus provides a more ambitious benchmark than that considered in the previous literature. Our estimator asymptotically achieves the new oracle risk (under appropriate conditions) and at the same time is minimax. The group-linear estimator is particularly advantageous in situations where the true means and observed variances are empirically dependent. To demonstrate the merits of the proposed methods in real applications, we analyze the baseball data used by Brown (2008), where the group-linear methods achieved the prediction error of the best nonparametric estimates that have been applied to the dataset, and significantly lower error than other parametric and semiparametric empirical Bayes estimators.},

  abstract = {Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on European training data suffer reduced accuracy in non-European target populations, exacerbating health disparities. This loss of accuracy predominantly stems from LD differences, MAF differences (including population-specific SNPs), and/or causal effect size differences. PRS based on training data from the non-European target population do not suffer from these limitations, but are currently limited by much smaller training sample sizes. Here, we propose PolyPred, a method that improves cross-population polygenic prediction by combining two complementary predictors: a new predictor that leverages functionally informed fine-mapping to estimate causal effects (instead of tagging effects), addressing LD differences; and BOLT-LMM, a published predictor. In the special case where a large training sample is available in the non-European target population (or a closely related population), we propose PolyPred+, which further incorporates the non-European training data, addressing MAF differences and causal effect size differences. PolyPred and PolyPred+ require individual-level training data (for their BOLT-LMM component), but we also propose analogous methods that replace the BOLTLMM component with summary statistic-based components if only summary statistics are available. We applied PolyPred to 49 diseases and complex traits in 4 UK Biobank populations using UK Biobank British training data (average N=325K), and observed statistically significant average relative improvements in prediction accuracy vs. BOLT-LMM ranging from +7\% in South Asians to +32\% in Africans (and vs. LDpruning + P-value thresholding (P+T) ranging from +77\% to +164\%), consistent with simulations. We applied PolyPred+ to 23 diseases and complex traits in UK Biobank East Asians using both UK Biobank British (average N=325K) and Biobank Japan (average N=124K) training data, and observed statistically significant average relative improvements in prediction accuracy of +24\% vs. BOLT-LMM and +12\% vs. PolyPred. The summary statistic-based analogues of PolyPred and PolyPred+ attained similar improvements. In conclusion, PolyPred and PolyPred+ improve cross-population polygenic prediction accuracy, ameliorating health disparities.},

  abstract = {The estimation of signal covariance matrices is a crucial part of many signal processing algorithms. In some applications, the structure of the problem suggests that the underlying, true covariance matrix is the Kronecker product of two valid covariance matrices. Examples of such problems are channel modeling for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications and signal modeling of EEG data. In applications, it may also be that the Kronecker factors in turn can be assumed to possess additional, linear structure. The maximum-likelihood (ML) method for the associated estimation problem has been proposed previously. It is asymptotically efficient but has the drawback of requiring an iterative search for the maximum of the likelihood function. Two methods that are fast and noniterative are proposed in this paper. Both methods are shown to be asymptotically efficient. The first method is a noniterative variant of a well-known alternating maximization technique for the likelihood function. It performs on par with ML in simulations but has the drawback of not allowing for extra structure in addition to the Kronecker structure. The second method is based on covariance matching principles and does not suffer from this drawback. However, while the large sample performance is the same, it performs somewhat worse than the first estimator in small samples. In addition, the Cramér–Rao lower bound for the problem is derived in a compact form. The problem of estimating the Kronecker factors and the problem of detecting if the Kronecker structure is a good model for the covariance matrix of a set of samples are related. Therefore, the problem of detecting the dimensions of the Kronecker factors based on the minimum values of the criterion functions corresponding to the two proposed estimation methods is also treated in this work.},

  abstract = {Gene-environment interactions represent the modification of genetic effects by environmental exposures and are critical for understanding disease and informing personalized medicine. These often induce differential phenotypic variance across genotypes; these variance-quantitative trait loci can be prioritized in a two-stage interaction detection strategy to greatly reduce the computational and statistical burden and enable testing of a broader range of exposures. We perform genome-wide variance-quantitative trait locus analysis for 20 serum cardiometabolic biomarkers by multi-ancestry meta-analysis of 350,016 unrelated participants in the UK Biobank, identifying 182 independent locus-biomarker pairs (p\,{$<$}\,4.5×10−9). Most are concentrated in a small subset (4\%) of loci with genome-wide significant main effects, and 44\% replicate (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) in the Women’s Genome Health Study (N\,=\,23,294). Next, we test each locus-biomarker pair for interaction across 2380 exposures, identifying 847 significant interactions (p\,{$<$}\,2.4×10−7), of which 132 are independent (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) after accounting for correlation between exposures. Specific examples demonstrate interaction of triglyceride-associated variants with distinct body mass- versus body fat-related exposures as well as genotype-specific associations between alcohol consumption and liver stress at the ADH1B gene. Our catalog of variance-quantitative trait loci and gene-environment interactions is publicly available in an online portal.},

We demonstrate that this method is able to predict neutrophil and lymphocyte specific cis-eQTLs and replicate these predictions in independent cell-type specific datasets.

Currently, only a fraction of the genetic variants underlying Alzheimer’s disease have been identified. Here we show that increased sample sizes allowed identification of seven previously unidentified genetic loci contributing to Alzheimer’s disease. This study highlights microglia, immune cells and protein catabolism as relevant to late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, while identifying and prioritizing previously unidentified genes of potential interest. We anticipate that these results can be included in larger meta-analyses of Alzheimer’s disease to identify further genetic variants that contribute to Alzheimer’s pathology.},

  author = {Winn, John and Bishop, Christopher M},
  abstract = {Bayesian inference is now widely established as one of the principal foundations for machine learning. In practice, exact inference is rarely possible, and so a variety of approximation techniques have been developed, one of the most widely used being a deterministic framework called variational inference. In this paper we introduce Variational Message Passing (VMP), a general purpose algorithm for applying variational inference to Bayesian Networks. Like belief propagation, VMP proceeds by sending messages between nodes in the network and updating posterior beliefs using local operations at each node. Each such update increases a lower bound on the log evidence (unless already at a local maximum). In contrast to belief propagation, VMP can be applied to a very general class of conjugate-exponential models because it uses a factorised variational approximation. Furthermore, by introducing additional variational parameters, VMP can be applied to models containing non-conjugate distributions. The VMP framework also allows the lower bound to be evaluated, and this can be used both for model comparison and for detection of convergence. Variational message passing has been implemented in the form of a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for BayEsian networkS’) which allows models to be specified graphically and then solved variationally without recourse to coding.},

  abstract = {Although the historically different fields of quantitative genetics and epidemiology are converging to answer fundamental questions about genetic variation in risk underlying human diseases, the plethora of measures to quantify the contribution of variants to disease risk have differing terminology and assumptions, which obfuscate their use and interpretation.In this Analysis, we consider and contrast the most commonly used measures that assess disease risk contributed to the population by individual variants — the heritability of disease liability explained, approximate heritability explained, the sibling recurrence risk explained, the proportion of genetic variance explained on a logarthimic relative risk scale, the area under the receiver–operating curve (AUC) and the population attributable fraction (PAF) — and give numerical examples in breast cancer, Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis and schizophrenia.We discuss the properties of these measures, show how they are connected to each other, consider the situations for which they are best suited and provide an online tool for their calculation.The most appropriate measure to use depends on the importance given to the frequency of a risk variant relative to its effect size on disease and on the baseline to which importance is expressed. These factors should be explicitly considered when assessing the contribution of genetic variants to disease.We recommend investigators to focus primarily on the heritability of liability or genetic variance on the logarthimic relative risk scale explained, as they give estimates that are less sensitive to rare high-risk variants than the other measures considered here. Moreover, we caution against using the PAF for genetic risk variants because it has various undesirable properties.The concept of individual loci providing an explanation for disease is less straightforward than it may seem at first sight, and we recommend investigators to undertake sensitivity analyses that explore how measures of the contribution of genetic variants to risk vary across a range of underlying assumptions.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have laid the foundation for investigations into the biology of complex traits, drug development and clinical guidelines. However, the majority of discovery efforts are based on data from populations of European ancestry1–3. In light of the differential genetic architecture that is known to exist between populations, bias in representation can exacerbate existing disease and healthcare disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they have a low frequency or are completely absent in European populations, especially as the field shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population-specific4–10. Additionally, effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derived in one population may not accurately extrapolate to other populations11,12. Here we demonstrate the value of diverse, multi-ethnic participants in large-scale genomic studies. The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study conducted a GWAS of 26 clinical and behavioural phenotypes in 49,839~non-European individuals. Using strategies tailored for analysis of multi-ethnic and admixed populations, we describe a framework for analysing diverse populations, identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalogue associations across these traits. Our data show evidence of effect-size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantial benefits for fine-mapping using diverse cohorts and insights into clinical implications. In the United States—where minority populations have a disproportionately higher burden of chronic conditions13—the lack of representation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. We strongly advocate for continued, large genome-wide efforts in diverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities.},

  abstract = {We pursue tractable Bayesian analysis of generalized linear models (GLMs) for categorical data. Thus far, GLMs are difficult to scale to more than a few dozen categories due to non-conjugacy or strong posterior dependencies when using conjugate auxiliary variable methods. We define a new class of GLMs for categorical data called categorical-from-binary (CB) models. Each CB model has a likelihood that is bounded by the product of binary likelihoods, suggesting a natural posterior approximation. This approximation makes inference straightforward and fast; using well-known auxiliary variables for probit or logistic regression, the product of binary models admits conjugate closed-form variational inference that is embarrassingly parallel across categories and invariant to category ordering. Moreover, an independent binary model simultaneously approximates multiple CB models. Bayesian model averaging over these can improve the quality of the approximation for any given dataset. We show that our approach scales to thousands of categories, outperforming posterior estimation competitors like Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) and No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) in the time required to achieve fixed prediction quality.},

A key challenge is understanding the interactions between signatures, particularly as DNA repair deficiencies often modify the effects of other mutagens. Here, we introduce RepairSig, a computational method that explicitly models additive primary mutagenic processes; non-additive secondary processes, which interact with the primary processes; and a mutation opportunity, that is, the distribution of sites across the genome that are vulnerable to damage or preferentially repaired. We demonstrate that RepairSig accurately recapitulates experimentally identified signatures, identifies autonomous signatures of deficient DNA repair processes, and explains mismatch repair deficiency in breast cancer by de novo inference of both primary and secondary signatures from patient data.

Existing gene set tests that rely on gene permutation are shown here to be extremely sensitive to inter-gene correlation. Several data sets are analyzed to show that inter-gene correlation is non-ignorable even for experiments on homogeneous cell populations using genetically identical model organisms. A new gene set test procedure (CAMERA) is proposed based on the idea of estimating the inter-gene correlation from the data, and using it to adjust the gene set test statistic. An efficient procedure is developed for estimating the inter-gene correlation and characterizing its precision. CAMERA is shown to control the type I error rate correctly regardless of inter-gene correlations, yet retains excellent power for detecting genuine differential expression. Analysis of breast cancer data shows that CAMERA recovers known relationships between tumor subtypes in very convincing terms. CAMERA can be used to analyze specified sets or as a pathway analysis tool using a database of molecular signatures.},

These techniques provide useful tools not only for the design of highly practical algorithms with provable optimality, but also for establishing the fundamental limits of the inference problems through the method of moment matching. The effectiveness of the polynomial method is demonstrated in concrete problems such as entropy and support size estimation, distinct elements problem, and learning Gaussian mixture models.},

  abstract = {As datasets grow richer, an important challenge is to leverage the full features in the data to maximize the number of useful discoveries while controlling for false positives. We address this problem in the context of multiple hypotheses testing, where for each hypothesis, we observe a p-value along with a set of features specific to that hypothesis. For example, in genetic association studies, each hypothesis tests the correlation between a variant and the trait. We have a rich set of features for each variant (e.g. its location, conservation, epigenetics etc.) which could inform how likely the variant is to have a true association. However popular testing approaches, such as Benjamini-Hochberg's procedure (BH) and independent hypothesis weighting (IHW), either ignore these features or assume that the features are categorical. We propose a new algorithm, NeuralFDR, which automatically learns a discovery threshold as a function of all the hypothesis features. We parametrize the discovery threshold as a neural network, which enables flexible handling of multi-dimensional discrete and continuous features as well as efficient end-to-end optimization. We prove that NeuralFDR has strong false discovery rate (FDR) guarantees, and show that it makes substantially more discoveries in synthetic and real datasets. Moreover, we demonstrate that the learned discovery threshold is directly interpretable.},

  abstract = {Signal denoising—also known as non-parametric regression—is often performed through shrinkage estimation in a transformed (e.g., wavelet) domain; shrinkage in the transformed domain corresponds to smoothing in the original domain. A key question in such applications is how much to shrink, or, equivalently, how much to smooth. Empirical Bayes shrinkage methods provide an attractive solution to this problem; they use the data to estimate a distribution of underlying “effects,” hence automatically select an appropriate amount of shrinkage. However, most existing implementations of empirical Bayes shrinkage are less flexible than they could be—both in their assumptions on the underlying distribution of effects, and in their ability to handle heteroskedasticity—which limits their signal denoising applications. Here we address this by adopting a particularly flexible, stable and computationally convenient empirical Bayes shrinkage method and applying it to several signal denoising problems.

  abstract = {Enrichment analysis of gene sets is a popular approach that provides a functional interpretation of genome-wide expression data. Existing tests are affected by inter-gene correlations, resulting in a high Type I error. The most widely used test, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, relies on computationally intensive permutations of sample labels to generate a null distribution that preserves gene–gene correlations. A more recent approach, CAMERA, attempts to correct for these correlations by estimating a variance inflation factor directly from the data. Although these methods generate P-values for detecting gene set activity, they are unable to produce confidence intervals or allow for post hoc comparisons. We have developed a new computational framework for Quantitative Set Analysis of Gene Expression (QuSAGE). QuSAGE accounts for inter-gene correlations, improves the estimation of the variance inflation factor and, rather than evaluating the deviation from a null hypothesis with a P-value, it quantifies gene-set activity with a complete probability density function. From this probability density function, P-values and confidence intervals can be extracted and post hoc analysis can be carried out while maintaining statistical traceability. Compared with Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and CAMERA, QuSAGE exhibits better sensitivity and specificity on real data profiling the response to interferon therapy (in chronic Hepatitis C virus patients) and Influenza A virus infection. QuSAGE is available as an R package, which includes the core functions for the method as well as functions to plot and visualize the results.},

Contrary to procedures that start with a \$p\$-value for each hypothesis, our method analyzes the entire data set to adaptively estimate an optimal \$p\$-value transform based on an empirical Bayes model. Despite the extra adaptivity, our method controls FDR in finite samples even if the empirical Bayes model is incorrect or the estimation is poor. An extension, the Double BONuS procedure, validates the empirical Bayes model to guard against power loss due to model misspecification.},

We applied MESC to GWAS summary statistics for 42 traits (average N\,=\,323,000) and cis-eQTL summary statistics for 48 tissues from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) consortium. Averaging across traits, only 11\,±\,2\% of heritability was mediated by assayed gene expression levels. Expression-mediated heritability was enriched in genes with evidence of selective constraint and genes with disease-appropriate annotations. Our results demonstrate that assayed bulk tissue eQTLs, although disease relevant, cannot explain the majority of disease heritability.},

  abstract = {The human immune system displays substantial variation between individuals, leading to differences in susceptibility to autoimmune disease. We present single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1,267,758 peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 982 healthy human subjects. For 14 cell types, we identified 26,597 independent cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and 990 trans-eQTLs, with most showing cell type–specific effects on gene expression. We subsequently show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from naïve to memory states and demonstrate how commonly segregating alleles lead to interindividual variation in immune function. Finally, using a Mendelian randomization approach, we identify the causal route by which 305 risk loci contribute to autoimmune disease at the cellular level. This work brings together genetic epidemiology with scRNA-seq to uncover drivers of interindividual variation in the immune system.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               The human immune system has evolved to maintain tissue homeostasis and target exogenous pathogens by regulating specialized cell populations. It displays substantial variation between individuals, defining how people vary in susceptibility to disease and respond to pathogens or cancer.                                         RATIONALE               Our knowledge of how genetic differences contribute to immune variation at the cellular level has been limited by two main challenges in the generation of data at single-cell resolution. One of these challenges is to sequence from many individuals and the other is to sequence a large number of cells from each individual. Addressing these challenges is necessary to dissect the genetic and molecular underpinnings of common, heterogeneous diseases.                                         RESULTS               We present the OneK1K cohort, which consists of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 1.27 million peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMBCs) collected from 982 donors. We developed a framework for the classification of individual cells, and by combining the scRNA-seq data with genotype data, we mapped the genetic effects on gene expression in each of 14 immune cell types and identified 26,597 independent cis–expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). We show that most of these have an allelic effect on gene expression that is cell type–specific. Our results replicated in two independent cohorts, one of which comprises individuals with a different ancestry to our discovery cohort. Over all loci, our discovery and replication cohorts have a concordance of allelic direction ranging from 72.2 to 98.1\% across cell types.               Using the top associated eQTL single-nucleotide polymorphism (eSNP) at each locus outside the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region, we identified 990 trans-acting effects, most (63.6\%) of which were cell type–specific. We show how eQTLs have dynamic allelic effects in B cells that are transitioning from naïve to memory states. Overall, we identified a set of 1988 eSNP–eGene (a gene with an eQTL) pairs expressed across the B cell maturation landscape, of which 333 have a statistically significant change in their allelic effect as B cells differentiate. Of these, 66\% were only identified from the dynamic eQTL analysis and were not observed when testing for effects independently in cell types, highlighting the importance of investigating cell state–specific effects that underlie immune cell function. We investigated how eQTLs affect the expression variation of essential immune genes in specific cell types and provided experimental support for established hypotheses of cellular mechanisms in complex autoimmune diseases.                                Finally, we integrated genetic association data for seven common autoimmune diseases and identified significant enrichment of genetic effects operating in a cell type–specific manner. Through colocalization of single-cell eQTL and genome-wide association study (GWAS) loci, we found that 19\% of cis-eQTLs share the same causal locus as a GWAS risk association. Using a Mendelian randomization approach, we uncovered the causal route by which 305 loci contribute to autoimmune disease through changes in gene expression in specific cell types and subsets. Of the shared causal loci, 38.4\% are outside the MHC region and exhibit highly cell-specific effects. Highlighting multiple sclerosis, we identified the causal route underlying 57 risk loci. For example, we show that the loci at 3q12 causally acts through changes in                 EAF2                 expression, but only in immature and naïve B (B                 IN                 ) and memory B (B                 Mem                 ) cells, despite this gene being ubiquitously expressed in all cell types in our data.                                                        CONCLUSION               This work brings together population genetics and scRNA-seq data to uncover drivers of interindividual variation in the immune system. Our results demonstrate how segregating genetic variation influences the expression of genes that encode proteins involved in critical immune regulatory and signaling pathways in a cell type–specific manner. Understanding the genetic underpinnings of immune system regulation will have broad implications in the treatment of autoimmune diseases and infections, transplantation, and cancers.                                                   Single-cell eQTL mapping and colocalization with autoimmune disease risk loci.                                        scRNA-seq data from 1.27 million PBMCs were used to identify 26,597 cis-eQTLs (gray box). Dynamic eQTLs were uncovered as cells move from a naïve to a memory state (top right). Genetic variation between individuals influences immune regulation in a cell type–specific manner (middle right). In this study, 990 trans-eQTL effects (bottom right) and the causal effects for 305 autoimmune disease loci were identified (bottom left).

To identify how implicated loci affect gene expression in immune cells from individuals from different populations, two groups performed single-cell RNA sequencing of immune cells, with each study investigating hundreds of individuals and more than 1 million immune cells (see the Perspective by Sumida and Hafler). These studies examined both proximal (cis) and distal (trans) genetic variants affecting gene expression in 14 different immune cell types. Perez               et al               . studied healthy individuals of both European and Asian descent, as well as individuals diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus. Yazar               et al               . performed a population-based study investigating how segregating alleles contribute to variation in immune function. Integrating these data with autoimmune disease cohorts identifies causal effects for more than 160 loci. Both studies observe how gene expression patterns are cell-type and context specific and can explain observed variation in immune cell function among individuals. Both studies also identify causal links between genome-wide analyses and expression quantitative trait loci, identifying potential mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases. —LMZ                        ,              Cell type and context affects gene expression affecting immune-mediated disease.},

  abstract = {Bayesian modeling is now ubiquitous in problems of large-scale inference even when frequentist criteria are in mind for evaluating the performance of a procedure. By far most popular in the statistical literature of the past decade and a half are empirical Bayes methods, that have shown in practice to improve significantly over strictly-frequentist competitors in many different problems. As an alternative to empirical Bayes methods, in this paper we propose hierarchical Bayes modeling for large-scale problems, and address two separate points that, in our opinion, deserve more attention. The first is nonparametric "deconvolution" methods that are applicable also outside the sequence model. The second point is the adequacy of Bayesian modeling for situations where the parameters are by assumption deterministic. We provide partial answers to both: first, we demonstrate how our methodology applies in the analysis of a logistic regression model. Second, we appeal to Robbins's compound decision theory and provide an extension, to give formal justification for the Bayesian approach in the sequence case.},

Recent work has suggested this could be because many genetic variants, each with individually small effects, compose their genetic architecture, limiting the power of GWAS, given currently obtainable sample sizes. In this scenario, Bonferroni-derived thresholds are severely underpowered to detect the vast majority of associations. Local false discovery rate (fdr) methods provide more power to detect non-null associations, but implicit assumptions about the exchangeability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) limit their ability to discover non-null loci.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have largely failed to identify most of the genetic basis of highly heritable diseases and complex traits. Recent work has suggested this could be because many genetic variants, each with individually small effects, compose their genetic architecture, limiting the power of GWAS, given currently obtainable sample sizes. In this scenario, Bonferroni-derived thresholds are severely underpowered to detect the vast majority of associations. Local false discovery rate (fdr) methods provide more power to detect non-null associations, but implicit assumptions about the exchangeability of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) limit their ability to discover non-null loci.},

  abstract = {Embryoid bodies (EBs) resemble self-organizing aggregates of pluripotent stem cells that recapitulate some aspects of early embryogenesis. Within few days, the cells undergo a transition from rather homogeneous epithelial-like pluripotent stem cell colonies into a three-dimensional organization of various cell types with multifaceted cell–cell interactions and lumen formation—a process associated with repetitive epithelial-mesenchymal transitions. In the last few years, culture methods have further evolved to better control EB size, growth, cellular composition, and organization—e.g., by the addition of morphogens or different extracellular matrix molecules. There is a growing perception that the mechanical properties, cell mechanics, and cell signaling during EB development are also influenced by physical cues to better guide lineage specification; substrate elasticity and topography are relevant, as well as shear stress and mechanical strain. Epithelial structures outside and inside EBs support the integrity of the cell aggregates and counteract mechanical stress. Furthermore, hydrogels can be used to better control the organization and lineage-specific differentiation of EBs. In this review, we summarize how EB formation is accompanied by a variety of biomechanical parameters that need to be considered for the directed and reproducible self-organization of early cell fate decisions.},

We apply the method to 28 complex traits in the UK Biobank data (N\,=\,126,752) and show that on average, 6\% of SNPs have nonzero effects, which in total explain 22\% of phenotypic variance. We detect significant (P\,{$<$}\,0.05/28) signatures of natural selection in the genetic architecture of 23 traits, including reproductive, cardiovascular, and anthropometric traits, as well as educational attainment. The significant estimates of the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency in complex traits are consistent with a model of negative (or purifying) selection, as confirmed by forward simulation. We conclude that negative selection acts pervasively on the genetic variants associated with human complex traits.},

We develop a fast algorithm to implement the proposed procedure and prove its asymptotic validity even when the underlying model is misspecified and the p-values are weakly dependent (e.g., strong mixing). Extensive simulations are conducted to study the finite sample performance of the proposed method and we demonstrate that the new approach improves over the state-of-the-art approaches by being flexible, robust, powerful and computationally efficient. We finally apply the method to several omics datasets arising from genomics studies with the aim to identify omics features associated with some clinical and biological phenotypes. We show that the method is overall the most powerful among competing methods, especially when the signal is sparse.

  abstract = {In this paper we study the computation of the nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator (NPMLE) in multivariate mixture models. Our first approach discretizes this infinite dimensional convex optimization problem by fixing the support points of the NPMLE and optimizing over the mixture proportions. In this context we propose, leveraging the sparsity of the solution, an efficient and scalable semismooth Newton based augmented Lagrangian method (ALM). Our algorithm beats the state-of-the-art methods\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite\{koenker2017rebayes, kim2020fast\} and can handle \$n \textbackslash approx 10\^6\$ data points with \$m \textbackslash approx 10\^4\$ support points. Our second procedure, which combines the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with the ALM approach above, allows for joint optimization of both the support points and the probability weights. For both our algorithms we provide formal results on their (superlinear) convergence properties. The computed NPMLE can be immediately used for denoising the observations in the framework of empirical Bayes. We propose new denoising estimands in this context along with their consistent estimates. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of our methods. In particular, we employ our procedures to analyze two astronomy data sets: (i) Gaia-TGAS Catalog\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite\{anderson2018improving\} containing \$n \textbackslash approx 1.4 \textbackslash times 10\^6\$ data points in two dimensions, and (ii) the \$d=19\$ dimensional data set from the APOGEE survey\textasciitilde\textbackslash cite\{majewski2017apache\} with \$n \textbackslash approx 2.7 \textbackslash times 10\^4\$.},

Here we introduce AdaFDR, a fast and flexible method that adaptively learns the optimal p-value threshold from covariates to significantly improve detection power. On eQTL analysis of the GTEx data, AdaFDR discovers 32\% more associations than BH at the same false discovery rate. We prove that AdaFDR controls false discovery proportion and show that it makes substantially more discoveries while controlling false discovery rate (FDR) in extensive experiments. AdaFDR is computationally efficient and allows multi-dimensional covariates with both numeric and categorical values, making it broadly useful across many applications.},

  abstract = {Motivation Gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) are widely used in genomic research to identify underlying biological mechanisms (defined by the gene sets), such as Gene Ontology terms and molecular pathways. There are two caveats in the currently available methods: (i) they are typically designed for group comparisons or regression analyses, which do not utilize temporal information efficiently in time-series of transcriptomics measurements; and (ii) genes overlapping in multiple molecular pathways are considered multiple times in hypothesis testing. Results We propose an inferential framework for GSEA based on functional data analysis, which utilizes the temporal information based on functional principal component analysis, and disentangles the effects of overlapping genes by a functional extension of the elastic-net regression. Furthermore, the hypothesis testing for the gene sets is performed by an extension of Mann-Whitney U test which is based on weighted rank sums computed from correlated observations. By using both simulated datasets and a large-scale time-course gene expression data on human influenza infection, we demonstrate that our method has uniformly better receiver operating characteristic curves, and identifies more pathways relevant to immune-response to human influenza infection than the competing approaches.

Starting from a random initialization, Pathfinder locates normal approximations to the target density along a quasi-Newton optimization path, with local covariance estimated using the inverse Hessian estimates produced by the optimizer. Pathfinder returns draws from the approximation with the lowest estimated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to the true posterior. We evaluate Pathfinder on a wide range of posterior distributions, demonstrating that its approximate draws are better than those from automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI) and comparable to those produced by short chains of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), as measured by 1-Wasserstein distance. Compared to ADVI and short dynamic HMC runs, Pathfinder requires one to two orders of magnitude fewer log density and gradient evaluations, with greater reductions for more challenging posteriors. Importance resampling over multiple runs of Pathfinder improves the diversity of approximate draws, reducing 1-Wasserstein distance further and providing a measure of robustness to optimization failures on plateaus, saddle points, or in minor modes. The Monte Carlo KL-divergence estimates are embarrassingly parallelizable in the core Pathfinder algorithm, as are multiple runs in the resampling version, further increasing Pathfinder's speed advantage with multiple cores.},

  abstract = {To model categorical response variables given their covariates, we propose a permuted and augmented stick-breaking (paSB) construction that one-to-one maps the observed categories to randomly permuted latent sticks. This new construction transforms multinomial regression into regression analysis of stick-specific binary random variables that are mutually independent given their covariate-dependent stick success probabilities, which are parameterized by the regression coefficients of their corresponding categories. The paSB construction allows transforming an arbitrary cross-entropy-loss binary classifier into a Bayesian multinomial one. Specifically, we parameterize the negative logarithms of the stick failure probabilities with a family of covariate-dependent softplus functions to construct nonparametric Bayesian multinomial softplus regression, and transform Bayesian support vector machine (SVM) into Bayesian multinomial SVM. These Bayesian multinomial regression models are not only capable of providing probability estimates, quantifying uncertainty, increasing robustness, and producing nonlinear classification decision boundaries, but also amenable to posterior simulation. Example results demonstrate their attractive properties and performance.},

We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6\,min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},

  abstract = {In genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for thousands of phenotypes in large biobanks, most binary traits have substantially fewer cases than controls. Both of the widely used approaches, the linear mixed model and the recently proposed logistic mixed model, perform poorly; they produce large type I error rates when used to analyze unbalanced case-control phenotypes. Here we propose a scalable and accurate generalized mixed model association test that uses the saddlepoint approximation to calibrate the distribution of score test statistics. This method, SAIGE (Scalable and Accurate Implementation of GEneralized mixed model), provides accurate P values even when case-control ratios are extremely unbalanced. SAIGE uses state-of-art optimization strategies to reduce computational costs; hence, it is applicable to GWAS for thousands of phenotypes by large biobanks. Through the analysis of UK Biobank data of 408,961 samples from white British participants with European ancestry for\,{$>$}\,1,400 binary phenotypes, we show that SAIGE can efficiently analyze large sample data, controlling for unbalanced case-control ratios and sample relatedness.},

Notably, JTI includes the single-tissue imputation method PrediXcan as a special case and outperforms other single-tissue approaches (the Bayesian sparse linear mixed model and Dirichlet process regression). MR-JTI models variant-level heterogeneity (primarily due to horizontal pleiotropy, addressing a major challenge of transcriptome-wide association study interpretation) and performs causal inference with type I error control. We make explicit the connection between the genetic architecture of gene expression and of complex traits and the suitability of Mendelian randomization as a causal inference strategy for transcriptome-wide association studies. We provide a resource of imputation models generated from GTEx and PsychENCODE panels. Analysis of biobanks and meta-analysis data, and extensive simulations show substantially improved statistical power, replication and causal mapping rate for JTI relative to existing approaches.},

  abstract = {Linear mixed models (LMMs) are among the most commonly used tools for genetic association studies. However, the standard method for estimating variance components in LMMs—the restricted maximum likelihood estimation method (REML)—suffers from several important drawbacks: REML requires individual-level genotypes and phenotypes from all samples in the study, is computationally slow, and produces downward-biased estimates in case control studies. To remedy these drawbacks, we present an alternative framework for variance component estimation, which we refer to as MQS. MQS is based on the method of moments (MoM) and the minimal norm quadratic unbiased estimation (MINQUE) criterion, and brings two seemingly unrelated methods—the renowned Haseman–Elston (HE) regression and the recent LD score regression (LDSC)—into the same unified statistical framework. With this new framework, we provide an alternative but mathematically equivalent form of HE that allows for the use of summary statistics. We provide an exact estimation form of LDSC to yield unbiased and statistically more efficient estimates. A key feature of our method is its ability to pair marginal z-scores computed using all samples with SNP correlation information computed using a small random subset of individuals (or individuals from a proper reference panel), while capable of producing estimates that can be almost as accurate as if both quantities are computed using the full data. As a result, our method produces unbiased and statistically efficient estimates, and makes use of summary statistics, while it is computationally efficient for large data sets. Using simulations and applications to 37 phenotypes from 8 real data sets, we illustrate the benefits of our method for estimating and partitioning SNP heritability in population studies as well as for heritability estimation in family studies.

However, most of these findings have unclear biological significance, because they often have small effects and occur in non-coding regions. Integration of GWAS with gene regulatory networks addresses both issues by aggregating weak genetic signals within regulatory programs. Here we develop a Bayesian framework that integrates GWAS summary statistics with regulatory networks to infer genetic enrichments and associations simultaneously. Our method improves upon existing approaches by explicitly modeling network topology to assess enrichments, and by automatically leveraging enrichments to identify associations. Applying this method to 18 human traits and 38 regulatory networks shows that genetic signals of complex traits are often enriched in interconnections specific to trait-relevant cell types or tissues. Prioritizing variants within enriched networks identifies known and previously undescribed trait-associated genes revealing biological and therapeutic insights.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified and replicated many genetic variants that are associated with diseases and disease-related complex traits. However, the biological mechanisms underlying these identified associations remain largely elusive. Exploring the biological mechanisms underlying these associations requires identifying trait-relevant tissues and cell types, as genetic variants likely influence complex traits in a tissue- and cell type-specific manner. Recently, several statistical methods have been developed to integrate genomic data with GWASs for identifying trait-relevant tissues and cell types. These methods often rely on different genomic information and use different statistical models for trait-tissue relevance inference. Here, we present a comprehensive technical review to summarize ten existing methods for trait-tissue relevance inference. These methods make use of different genomic information that include functional annotation information, expression quantitative trait loci information, genetically regulated gene expression information, as well as gene co-expression network information. These methods also use different statistical models that range from linear mixed models to covariance network models. We hope that this review can serve as a useful reference both for methodologists who develop methods and for applied analysts who apply these methods for identifying trait relevant tissues and cell types.},

  abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified thousands of genetic variants that are associated with many complex traits. However, their biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) have been recently proposed as an invaluable tool for investigating the potential gene regulatory mechanisms underlying variant-trait associations. Specifically, TWAS integrate GWAS with expression mapping studies based on a common set of variants and aim to identify genes whose GReX is associated with the phenotype. Various methods have been developed for performing TWAS and/or similar integrative analysis. Each such method has a different modeling assumption and many were initially developed to answer different biological questions. Consequently, it is not straightforward to understand their modeling property from a theoretical perspective.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in recording technologies have allowed neuroscientists to record simultaneous spiking activity from hundreds to thousands of neurons in multiple brain regions. Such large-scale recordings pose a major challenge to existing statistical methods for neural data analysis. Here we develop highly scalable approximate inference methods for Poisson generalized linear models (GLMs) that require only a single pass over the data. Our approach relies on a recently proposed method for obtaining approximate sufficient statistics for GLMs using polynomial approximations [Huggins et al., 2017], which we adapt to the Poisson GLM setting. We focus on inference using quadratic approximations to nonlinear terms in the Poisson GLM log-likelihood with Gaussian priors, for which we derive closed-form solutions to the approximate maximum likelihood and MAP estimates, posterior distribution, and marginal likelihood. We introduce an adaptive procedure to select the polynomial approximation interval and show that the resulting method allows for efficient and accurate inference and regularization of high-dimensional parameters. We use the quadratic estimator to fit a fully-coupled Poisson GLM to spike train data recorded from 831 neurons across five regions of the mouse brain for a duration of 41 minutes, binned at 1 ms resolution. Across all neurons, this model is fit to over 2 billion spike count bins and identifies fine-timescale statistical dependencies between neurons within and across cortical and subcortical areas.},

  abstract = {We introduce mvSuSiE, a multi-trait fine-mapping method for identifying putative causal variants from genetic association data (individual-level or summary data). mvSuSiE learns patterns of shared genetic effects from data, and exploits these patterns to improve power to identify causal SNPs. Comparisons on simulated data show that mvSuSiE is competitive in speed, power and precision with existing multi-trait methods, and uniformly improves on single-trait fine-mapping (SuSiE) in each trait separately. We applied mvSuSiE to jointly fine-map 16 blood cell traits using data from the UK Biobank. By jointly analyzing the traits and modeling heterogeneous effect sharing patterns, we discovered a much larger number of causal SNPs (ą3,000) compared with single-trait fine-mapping, and with narrower credible sets. mvSuSiE also more comprehensively characterized the ways in which the genetic variants affect one or more blood cell traits; 68\% of causal SNPs showed significant effects in more than one blood cell type.},

In this paper, the author proposes a modified Poisson regression approach (i.e., Poisson regression with a robust error variance) to estimate this effect measure directly. A simple 2-by-2 table is used to justify the validity of this approach. Results from a limited simulation study indicate that this approach is very reliable even with total sample sizes as small as 100. The method is illustrated with two data sets.},
